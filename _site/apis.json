            "description": "The field data and WorldView imagery were leveraged to generate an extensive set of segments labeled with land cover class. These segment interpretations provided the training and validation data for the mapping. Analysts reviewed each aerial and ground plot from the 2019 field survey, examining the plot center and training polygon over the WorldView mosaic, and reviewing field photos, cover estimates, and notes. For each plot, one image segment was identified as the primary example of the vegetation type of the plot (unless there was no suitable example segment, as in cases when a ground plot was targeting a small but distinct vegetation patch that was not captured in the image segmentation). Usually, the primary segment included or was close to the nominal plot center, but this was not always the case, since the target area for the aerial plots could encompass several segments.After identifying a primary segment, the analyst also identified a set of 0–15 secondary segments that were good examples of the same vegetation type. This assessment was informed by field experience, review of field photos of the landscape setting, and photo-interpretation of the WorldView mosaic.An additional set of auxiliary segments were identified and assigned to a land cover class. The first set of auxiliary segments was assigned to non-vegetated classes such as lakes, ponds, ocean, barrens, and snowfields or aufeis. While a limited effort was expended to sample such classes during field work, we knew that these would be readily identifiable with high confidence from the WorldView imagery and so focused the field sampling on vegetated classes.Later, after reviewing preliminary models and receiving feedback from Janet Jorgenson (retired plant ecologist for the Arctic Refuge), we added additional auxiliary segments for vegetated classes based on expert photo interpretation. These were designed to provide the model with additional training data to define the breakpoints between similar classes.Land cover classes were assigned to all of the primary, secondary, and auxiliary segments. 20% of the segments were randomly selected to be withheld from model training. The final model was validated using the reserved validation segment interpretation points (20% of the full set). These segments were not used to develop the model. The map class was extracted from the final land cover map for each validation point. A confusion matrix, overall accuracy metrics, and per-class performance metrics were calculated from the validation data.",

            "description": "This reference archives metadata about the collection of geospatial data which may be stored in a variety of file formats (e.g. shapefile, geodatabase) for the Oregon Coast NWRC: Surface Nesting Seabirds - Aerial Photographic Colony Surveys survey (PRIMR ID: FF01RORG00-002 and FF01RTAR00-002). Early records are not recorded digitally, these counts were done by projecting the slide image and manually counting birds on hardcopy. The metadata file will display where counts were done on hardcopy (analog) as well as those done digitally (GIS). Counts (from photographs) were initially started in 2014 but were not completed until 2020. These geospatial files represent the raw count of seabirds from non-georeferenced images. These raw point counts are not registered to any geospatial coordinates. They only line up with the image from which they were derived, no geospatial coordinates are attached to the raw images. Results of the counts are put through a secondary check and then numbers are entered into the complete Seabird Colony Count Catalog (Database) which can be downloaded from https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/125358, which is the authoritative source for bird count data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex manages an Imagery Program for collecting refuge-wide aerial imagery datasets that are used to monitor nesting seabirds on offshore islands. Aerial flights are generally conducted annually to monitor population status and trends, but the imagery is used for other resource monitoring purposes. Aerial photography has served as the primary means for monitoring populations of nesting seabirds, and the subsequent analysis of long-term seabird colony legacy data in the Pacific Northwest as a regional baseline. The 2014 set of photographs have been used to complete a refuge-wide colony count for 2014, where each photograph has a digital point file (hand count) of nesting seabirds stored in a geodatabase format. Census years include 1988, 1994, 2006, and 2014. Following the completion of the census counts described above, we counted a subsample of Oregon coast colonies using a size- and geographical-based stratified random sampling approach for all other survey years. The subsample was selected based on common murre populations, therefore no inferences can be drawn about Brandtâs cormorants without additional colony subsampling. The subsampling approach was informed by recommendations from bio-statistical experts based on colony size and location. We subsampled 45 colonies, which were counted over time. Including census year counts, our subsample years were 1988, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2014. A power analysis for the sampling design recommended for the Protocol Framework indicated that a minimum of 16 common murre within each region needed to be counted each year in order detect an average decline of 3.35% per year over a 15-year period (cumulative 40% decline) with 80% probability. With guidance from two statisticians, we randomly selected 6 small and 9 medium/large colonies per region for a total of 45 colonies to be counted each year to detect changes across the Oregon Coast.

Starting in 2012 photographs were taken using digital photography (hand-held camera). Counts (from photographs) were initially started in 2012 but were not completed until 2020. These geospatial files represent the raw count of seabirds from non-georeferenced images. These raw point counts are not registered to any geospatial coordinates. They only line up with the image from which they were derived, no geospatial coordinates are attached to the raw images. Results of the counts are put through a secondary check and then numbers are entered into the complete Seabird Colony Count Catalog (Database) which can be downloaded from https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/125358, which is the authoritative source for bird count data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex manages an Imagery Program for collecting refuge-wide aerial imagery datasets that are used to monitor nesting seabirds on offshore islands. Aerial flights are generally conducted annually to monitor population status and trends, but the imagery is used for other resource monitoring purposes. Aerial photography has served as the primary means for monitoring populations of nesting seabirds (Census years include 1988, 1994, 2006, and 2014), and the subsequent analysis of long-term seabird colony legacy data in the Pacific Northwest as a regional baseline. The 2012 set of photographs have been used to complete a refuge-wide colony subsample count for 2012, where each photograph in the subsample has a digital point file (hand count) of nesting seabirds stored in a geodatabase format. We counted a subsample of Oregon coast colonies using a size- and geographical-based stratified random sampling approach for all other survey years. The subsample was selected based on common murre populations, therefore no inferences can be drawn about Brandtâs cormorants without additional colony subsampling. The subsampling approach was informed by recommendations from bio-statistical experts based on colony size and location. We subsampled 45 colonies, which were counted over time. Including census year counts, our subsample years were 1988, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2014. A power analysis for the sampling design recommended for the Protocol Framework indicated that a minimum of 16 common murre within each region needed to be counted each year in order detect an average decline of 3.35% per year over a 15-year period (cumulative 40% decline) with 80% probability. With guidance from two statisticians, we randomly selected 6 small and 9 medium/large colonies per region for a total of 45 colonies to be counted each year to detect changes across the Oregon Coast.

            "description": "During June, we perform ground-based composition counts to estimate calf production, recruitment, and adult sex ratio.  We have radiocollared over 100 muskoxen in order to document seasonal shifts in distribution and habitat use, and to estimate survival and cause-specific mortality.Following the 1969 release, muskoxen increased rapidly in the Arctic Refuge, reaching a peak of approximately 400 individuals in 1986.  This was followed by expansion of the population’s range into contiguous areas of north-central Alaska and northwestern Canada.  We subsequently implemented cooperative surveys with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG), Parks Canada, and Yukon Department of Environment to monitor the entire population.  The number of muskoxen within the Refuge declined slightly, and then remained stable at about 325 from 1987 to 1998.We observed a precipitous decline in abundance of muskoxen within the Arctic Refuge beginning in 1999.  In 2003, we estimated that fewer than 50 muskoxen occurred within Refuge boundaries.  We attribute this decline to shifts in distribution, low calf recruitment, and decreased adult survival.  In a recent cooperative study with ADFG (Reynolds et al. 2002), we determined that predation by grizzly bears was a significant and increasing source of mortality for muskoxen.  The negative effect of predation on survival may be exacerbated by environmental conditions that limit access to forage, such as icing events and deep, persistent snows.  We are continuing to monitor the status of this muskox population and investigate factors responsible for observed trends.",

These surveys were conducted by helicopter over two – three days in early- to mid- June, coincident with late incubation/early hatching of common murres. During each survey, photographs were taken at an oblique angle and at 260-330 m flying altitude by two photographers using 35 mm cameras and 100-400 mm lenses. More than 63,000 images from these surveys of Oregon and Washington seabird colonies were available only in 35 mm film slide format. The inevitable degradation of these slides, some of which are now nearly 40 years old, made conversion to a stable digital format critical in order to prevent loss of data.A geospatial representation was created from the colony coordinates, to place a metadata record into a spatial context. The shapefile only includes photographs for the Oregon Coast NWRC. This is 63,346 images.",

            "description": "This reference archives metadata about the collection of geospatial data which may be stored in a variety of file formats (e.g. shapefile, geodatabase) for the Oregon Coast NWRC: Surface Nesting Seabirds - Aerial Photographic Colony Surveys survey (PRIMR ID: FF01RORG00-002 and FF01RTAR00-002). Early records are not recorded digitally, these counts were done by projecting the slide image and manually counting birds on hardcopy. The metadata file will display where counts were done on hardcopy (analog) as well as those done digitally (GIS). Counts (from photographs) were initially started in 1994 but were not completed until 2020. These geospatial files represent the raw count of seabirds from non-georeferenced images. These raw point counts are not registered to any geospatial coordinates. They only line up with the image from which they were derived, no geospatial coordinates are attached to the raw images. Results of the counts are put through a secondary check and then numbers are entered into the complete Seabird Colony Count Catalog (Database) which can be downloaded from https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/125358, which is the authoritative source for bird count data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex manages an Imagery Program for collecting refuge-wide aerial imagery datasets that are used to monitor nesting seabirds on offshore islands. Aerial flights are generally conducted annually to monitor population status and trends, but the imagery is used for other resource monitoring purposes. Aerial photography has served as the primary means for monitoring populations of nesting seabirds, and the subsequent analysis of long-term seabird colony legacy data in the Pacific Northwest as a regional baseline. The 1994 set of photographs have been used to complete a refuge-wide colony count for 1994, where each photograph has a digital point file (hand count) of nesting seabirds stored in a geodatabase format. Census years include 1988, 1994, 2006, and 2014. Following the completion of the census counts described above, we counted a subsample of Oregon coast colonies using a size- and geographical-based stratified random sampling approach for all other survey years. The subsample was selected based on common murre populations, therefore no inferences can be drawn about Brandtâs cormorants without additional colony subsampling. The subsampling approach was informed by recommendations from bio-statistical experts based on colony size and location. We subsampled 45 colonies, which were counted over time. Including census year counts, our subsample years were 1988, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2014. A power analysis for the sampling design recommended for the Protocol Framework indicated that a minimum of 16 common murre within each region needed to be counted each year in order detect an average decline of 3.35% per year over a 15-year period (cumulative 40% decline) with 80% probability. With guidance from two statisticians, we randomly selected 6 small and 9 medium/large colonies per region for a total of 45 colonies to be counted each year to detect changes across the Oregon Coast.

            "description": "This data release contains water level and velocity measurements from wave runup experiments performed in a laboratory flume setting. Wave-driven water level variability (and runup at the shoreline) is a significant cause of coastal flooding induced by storms. Wave runup is challenging to predict, particularly along tropical coral reef-fringed coastlines due to the steep bathymetric profiles and large bottom roughness generated by reef organisms. The 2012 University of Western Australia Fringing Reef Experiment (UWAFRE) measured water levels and velocities for sixteen wave and offshore (still) water level conditions on a 1:36 geometric scale fringing reef profile with and without bottom roughness. Experiments were performed in a 55-m long wave flume (Eastern Scheldt Flume) at Deltares, the Netherlands.

            "description": "Sea ice loss represents a stressor to the Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens), which feeds on benthic macroinvertebrates in the Bering and Chukchi seas. However, no studies have examined the effects of sea ice on foraging walrus space use patterns. Thus, we examined walrus foraging resource selection as a function of proximity to resting substrates and prey biomass with a matched use-availability design. We quantified biomass of 17 benthic taxa, which included amphipods, bivalves, polychaete, sand dollars, tunicates, and sipunculids. We included covariates for distance to sea ice and distance to land, and systematically developed a series of candidate models to examine interactions among benthic prey biomass and resting substrates. We ranked candidate models with Bayesian Information Criterion and made inferences on walrus resource selection based on the top-ranked model. Biomass of the bivalve family Tellinidae, distance to ice, distance to land, and the interaction of distances to ice and land were in the top-ranked model. Standardized model coefficients indicated that distance to ice explained the most variation in walrus foraging resource selection patterns followed by Tellinidae biomass. Distance to land and the interaction of distances to ice and land accounted for similar levels of variation in foraging walrus resource selection. These data represent the used and available resource units with the covariates of distance to land and distance to ice.",

For Arctic pinnipeds, the time allocated to active and resting behaviors could change with future reductions in sea ice cover and longer periods of open water. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) is a large Arctic pinniped that rests on sea ice or land between foraging trips to feed on the seafloor. This dataset contains behavioral data collected from 216 radio-tagged adult female walruses instrumented in the Chukchi Sea (2008–2014) that formed the basis of a Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects model that investigated probability that a walrus was in water foraging, in water not foraging, or hauled out, as a function of environmental covariates. The data are structured such that each line represents an hour of behavior collected during every third hour of the UTC day (hours 0 through 21), which was associated with temperature and wind metrics derived from the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset, as well as an index of the daily availability of sea ice based on the daily National Ice Center’s Marginal Ice Zone product and an index of the availability of land. Each record presents the walrus behavior recorded during the record’s hour, the previous hour, and the subsequent hour.",

            "description": "State-space models offer researchers an objective approach to modeling complex animal location datasets, and state-space model behavior classifications are often assumed to have a link to animal behavior. We evaluated the behavioral classification accuracy of a Bayesian state-space model in Pacific walruses using Argos satellite tags outfitted with sensors to detect animal behavior in real time. Specifically, tags were targeted to attach midway between the shoulders and each tag had a conductivity sensor and pressure transducer sensor integrated with an Argos satellite telemetry tag. At 1 s intervals, the pressure transducer recorded the depth of the tag and the conductivity sensor indicated whether the tag was in salt water. Two simple algorithms that ran onboard the tag summarized behavior information within 1-hr intervals to facilitate behavior data transmission through the Argos system using two indicator variables. One algorithm set the forage indicator variable to 1 if &amp;gt;50% of depth measurements exceeded 10 m during a 1-hr interval and to 0 if otherwise. A second algorithm set the wet indicator variable to 1 if &amp;gt;10% of conductivity measurements indicated the tag was in salt water during that 1-hr interval and to 0 if otherwise. Based on the values of these two indicator variables, we categorized each 1-hr interval into one of three behavior states. A combination of wet = 0 and forage = 0 for a 1-hr interval indicated the animal was primarily hauled-out during that period. Variable indicators of wet = 1 and forage = 0 indicated a walrus was primarily in water and not foraging (swimming) during the associated 1-hr interval. Finally, combinations of wet = 1 and foraging = 1 represented an individual foraging at depth for the corresponding 1-hr interval. To compare these real behaviors to modeled behaviors, we fit a two-state discrete-time continuous-space Bayesian state-space model to data from 306 Pacific walruses tagged in the Chukchi Sea. We matched predicted locations and behaviors from the state-space model (resident, transient behavior) to true animal behavior (foraging, swimming, hauled-out) and evaluated classification accuracy with kappa statistics and root mean square error. These data represent Bayesian state-space model output for 8 hr and 12 hr time steps.",

            "description": "Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been an increase in scientific interest, research effort, and information gathered on the geologic sedimentary character of the continental margins of the United States. Data and information from thousands of sources have increased our scientific understanding of the geologic origins of the margin surface but rarely have those data been combined into a unified database. Initially, usSEABED was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder, for assessments of marine-based aggregates and for studies of sea-floor habitats by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Since then, the USGS has continued to build up the database as a nationwide resource for many uses and applications. Previously published data derived from the usSEABED database have been released as three USGS data series publications containing data covering the U.S. Atlantic margin, the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean regions, and the Pacific coast (Reid and others, 2005; Buczkowski and others, 2006; and Reid and others, 2006). This expanded USGS data release unifies the data from these three publications and includes an additional 54 data sources added to usSEABED since the original data series, provides revised output files, and expands the data coverage to include usSEABED data from all areas within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as of the time of publication (including Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. overseas territories). The usSEABED database was created using the most recent stable version of the dbSEABED software available to the USGS at the time of release (specifically, dbSEABED software [NMEv, version date 4/23/2010] using the dbSEABED thesaurus [db9 dict.rtf, version date 8/21/2009], the component set up file for U.S. waters [SET ABUN 2016.txt, version date 5/29/2016], and the facies set up file for U.S. waters [SET FACI.txt, version date 3/16/2012]). The USGS Open-File Report “Sediments and the sea floor of the continental shelves and coastal waters of the United States: About the usSEABED integrated sea-floor-characterization database, built with the dbSEABED processing system” (Buczkowski and others, 2020) accompanies this data release and provides information on the usSEABED database as well as the dbSEABED data processing system. Users are encouraged to read this companion report to learn more about how usSEABED is built, how the data should be interpreted, and how they are best used.",

            "description": "In summer 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a 21-day geophysical program in deep water along the Atlantic continental margin by using R/V Marcus G. Langseth (Field Activity Number 2014-011-FA). The purpose of the seismic program was to collect multichannel seismic reflection and refraction data to determine sediment thickness. These data enable the United States to delineate its Extended Continental Shelf (ECS) along the Atlantic margin. The same data can also be used to understand large submarine landslides and therefore assess their potential tsunami hazard for infrastructure and communities living along the eastern seaboard. Supporting geophysical data were collected as marine magnetic data, gravity data, 3.5-kilohertz shallow seismic reflections, multibeam echo sounder bathymetry, and multibeam backscatter.  The survey was conducted from water depths of approximately 1,500 meters to abyssal seafloor depths greater than 5,000 meters. Approximately 2,761 kilometers of multi-channel seismic data was collected along with 30 sonobuoy profiles. This field program had two primary objectives: (1) to collect some of the data necessary to establish the outer limits of the U.S. Continental Shelf, or Extended Continental Shelf, as defined by Article 76 of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea and (2) to study the sudden mass transport of sediments down the continental margin as submarine landslides that pose potential tsunamigenic hazards to the Atlantic and Caribbean coastal communities.",

In this project, we used these zones of remarkable transition to develop macroclimate-based models for quantifying the regional responses of coastal wetland ecosystems to climate variation. In addition to providing important fish and wildlife habitat and supporting coastal food webs, these coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem goods and services including clean water, stable coastlines, food, recreational opportunities, and stored carbon. Our objective was to examine and forecast the effects of macroclimatic drivers on wetland ecosystem structure and function in the northern Gulf of Mexico.",

The data sets also contain U-Pb isotopic data and ages of detrital zircon from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks collected in the same region but also from the Taylor and Wood River Mountains of southwestern Alaska. The entire sample suite was collected as part of geological mapping and supporting geochemical and geochronological analysis conducted from 2004 to 2019 and funded by the Mineral Resources Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Zircon and (or) titanite were obtained from igneous and metamorphic rocks to determine the crystallization age and (or) age of metamorphism for the bedrock samples. Bulk rock samples were processed into concentrated mineral separates in USGS laboratories in Denver, Colorado, or by Apatite to Zircon, Inc. (A2Z) and analyzed by USGS research scientists at the Stanford-USGS Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe with Reverse-Geometry (SHRIMP-RG) at Stanford University. Detrital zircon grains were obtained from samples of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks to determine depositional age and sediment sources. Detrital zircon grains were separated from bulk bedrock samples and analyzed at one of three different laboratories [University of British Columbia (UBC, 2004 to 2006), at A2Z (2006 to 2009), and GeoSep Services (GSS, 2015 to 2019)] using laser-ablation-inductively-coupled-plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques. The data tables accompanying this data release report the isotopic composition of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) measured in each grain, ratios of two isotopes of lead (207Pb and 206Pb) and two isotopes of uranium (235U and 238U), and the age of each grain.

            "description": "Low-altitude (80 and 100 meters above ground level) digital images were taken over an area of the Plum Island Estuary and Parker River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Massachusetts using 3DR Solo unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) on February 27, 2018. These images were collected as part of an effort to document marsh stability over time and quantify sediment movement using UAS technology. Each UAS was equipped with either a Ricoh GRII digital camera for natural color photos, used to produce digital elevation models and ortho images, or a MicaSense RedEdge multi-spectral camera that captures five specific bands of the visible spectrum (blue, green, red, red edge, and near-infrared), which can be used to classify vegetation. The MicaSense camera covered a smaller subsection of the same polygonal area of the marsh that the Ricoh imaged. Some photographs contain black and white targets used as ground control points (GCPs), which were surveyed by a field crew with a high-precision Real Time Kinematic Global Position System. This data release includes the original images from both cameras, as well as a csv file containing the latitude and longitude coordinates, in Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 19N referenced to the North American Datum of 1983, of the ground control points needed to complete any photogrammetry projects using the original photographs, and GPS transect points used to evaluate the photogrammetry products created.",

            "description": "In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. Field activity information for this cruise is available on-line through the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geoscience Data System https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2005-004-FA.",

Three field trips were carried out in January 2015, June 2015, and January 2016 to obtain year-long high-resolution temporal records of water chemistry and environmental parameters below and above the surface at a site (Cenote Bang) within the Ox Bel Ha cave network. These efforts resulted in chemical records of dissolved methane concentrations and its stable carbon isotopic content and major ion concentrations (i.e., chloride and sulfate) in approximately 2.5-day resolution from January 2015 to January 2016, sampled by OsmoSamplers. In addition, sensor-based measurements of environmental parameters include year-long precipitation, barometric pressure, water level, flow velocity, and water temperature records. Field activities were carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program in conjunction with Texas AM University at Galveston.",

            "description": "As part of a larger investigation to understand groundwater-surface water interactions in Greenwich Bay, Rhode Island, a geophysical survey was conducted from a small research boat on 14-15 May 2009. The specific research objective was to gain an improved understanding of the role of direct groundwater discharge in delivery of excess nitrogen to the bay, which may have contributed to the development of low-oxygen conditions in waters of the bay and associated fish kills. Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values. This survey is identified as field activity 09021 (also referenced as 2009-021-FA) by the U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and additional information is available from: https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=2009-021-FA.",

Marsh elevation, relative to sea level, is maintained by both organic material and the deposition of inorganic sediment. Additionally, horizontal marsh extent is altered by lateral erosion and accretion. In wetlands within and near Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, parts of the salt marsh are eroding relatively rapidly. To understand the connection between sediment fluxes and these processes, the U.S. Geological Survey made oceanographic and water-quality measurements from August 2, 2016, to January 28, 2017, to quantify suspended-sediment concentration and sediment transport in tidal channels and open embayments in and near Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.",

            "description": "In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. Field activity information for this cruise is available on-line through the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geoscience Data System https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2005-004-FA.",

These measurements show the height of the river’s water surface, both in meters relative to the stream bed, as well as in meters relative to vertical geographic coordinates. Measurements were collected using a Global Water WL16 battery-operated vented water level logger in a hardened casing. The instrument was installed on October 17, 2011 on the left bank of the Elwha River at a power line crossing above the Elwha Surface Water Intake (at approximately river kilometer 5.6), which is downstream of the (now historical) Elwha Dam site. Data collection ended May 12, 2016. The data were collected as part of a study investigating responses of the Elwha River to the removal of two large dams: the Glines Canyon and Elwha dams. From July 2, 2015 to October 31, 2015 the gauge was buried under a gravel bar, and the data are not reliable. These data are flagged as “BURIED” in the spreadsheet’s “FLAG” column. From April 21, 2016 through May 12, 2016 periods of noise and bad data (flagged “NOISE” and “BAD”) interrupted valid data values. The gauge was beginning to fail, but comparison with USGS 12046260 stage data allowed identification of valid data. After May 12, 2016, significant deviations from expected values and increased noise appeared. This was interpreted as instrument failure and no further data were marked valid. Data are included for reference purposes but flagged as “BAD.”",

The Sanctuary’s research vessel, R/V Auk, visited 81 locations on Stellwagen Bank at which a customized Van Veen grab sampler (SEABOSS) equipped with a video camera and a CTD was deployed in drift mode to collect sediment for grain-size analysis, video imagery of the seabed, and measurements of water column properties.",

            "description": "In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

            "description": "One goal of the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program’s NGHP-02 expedition was to examine the geomechanical response of marine sediment to the extraction of methane from gas hydrate found offshore eastern India in the Bay of Bengal. Methane gas hydrate is a naturally occurring crystalline solid that sequesters methane in individual molecular cages in a lattice of water molecules. Methane gas hydrate is a potential energy resource, but whether extracting methane from gas hydrate in the marine subsurface is technically and economically viable remains an open research topic as of 2018. This data release provides insight about a poorly quantified aspect of this process: the reaction of fine-grained sediment particles (fines) to the change in pore water chemistry that occurs when methane is extracted from gas hydrate. Fines are an issue for production because they can get resuspended in the flow of fluid and gas toward the extraction well. As fines move, they can cluster and subsequently clog pore throats in the sediment, reducing permeability (which controls how easily methane can flow toward the extraction well). There are two main factors in determining the cluster structure (the size and fabric of the cluster) and the cluster formation and settling rates: the type of fine-grained particle and the chemistry of the surrounding pore water. Data in this study provide insight into both factors. Fine particles interact with each other primarily in response to electrical forces, and changes in pore water chemistry can significantly alter how those forces are communicated between particles. In marine systems, in situ pore water is an electrically conductive brine. As gas hydrate dissociates, however, fresh water is released along with the methane, making the pore water less conductive. Depending on the type of fine-grained particles involved, the pore water chemistry change enhances or diminishes the clustering and changes the rates at which the clusters form and settle. For this data release, specimens from the NGHP-02 expedition are observed during sedimentation (settling) tests in pore fluids of differing chemistry. The results included in this data release can (1) provide insight into the types of fines present, which can be difficult to quantify if using the more standard x-ray diffraction method for identifying fines and (2) indicate whether the in situ fines are likely to increase or decrease their capacity to clog pore throats as the pore water transitions from higher to lower salinity during gas hydrate dissociation.",

            "description": "In September 2018, the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center (WHCMSC), in collaboration with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), conducted high-resolution geophysical mapping and sediment sampling to determine the distribution of historical mine tailings on the floor of Lake Superior. Large amounts of waste material from copper mining, locally known as “stamp sands”, were dumped into the laFke in the early 20th century, with wide-reaching consequences that have continued into the present day. Mapping was focused offshore of the town of Gay on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan, where ongoing erosion and re-deposition of the stamp sands has buried miles of native, white-sand beaches and is steadily encroaching south onto Buffalo Reef, a large area of cobble/boulder substrate that supports productive fisheries in the lake. The objectives of this cooperative mapping project are to develop a framework for scientific research and provide baseline information required for management of resources within the coastal zone of northern Michigan. High resolution bathymetry and backscatter data reveal the irregular topography of the shallow, cobble-covered Buffalo Reef, and the relatively smooth, finer-grained sediment that covers adjacent, deeper parts of the lake floor. Previous research used numerous sediment samples to determine the general distribution of mine tailings on the lake floor in this area, but little information existed on the extent and thickness of the surficial deposits. The main priority of this project is to image the near-surface stratigraphy, specifically the surficial sand and mud that threaten to cover the reef, with seismic-reflection profiling systems. In addition to continuous coverage of bathymetric and backscatter data, this report includes a dense grid of closely spaced seismic profiles, which will guide efforts to mitigate the impacts on Buffalo Reef from contamination by the shifting stamp sands.",

            "description": "In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

            "description": "The grain size of sediment on the riverbed was measured during 20 surveys on the Elwha River, Washington, between 2006 and 2017. Most data were collected along the same transects where channel topography was measured (see related child item in this data release: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a989288e4b06990606de04b). Measurements of sediment ranging from medium sand to boulders were made using the CobbleCam digital photographic technique (Warrick and others, 2009), which uses a calibrated autocorrelation algorithm (Rubin, 2004) to calculate the mean grain size of sediment from pixels in downward-looking digital photographs. This technique yields grain-size values accurate to within 14 percent of those obtained by pebble counting (Wolman, 1954; Warrick and others, 2009). For samples finer than medium sand, we measured grain size using a Coulter laser particle-size analyzer at the USGS laboratory in Santa Cruz, California. Grain size was measured along subaerial portions of the survey transects within the bankfull channel. We also measured grain size of some sediment deposited after dam removal that did not coincide with survey transects (these sample locations are labeled “OffTransect” in the data file).

Site locations were determined using a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv). Core ANA15-RC1 BR contained two carbonate sand layers (Sand A1from 24.5-29 cm depth and Sand A2 from 32-35 cm depth). Core ANA15-RC6 BR contained a deeper carbonate sand layer (Sand A3 96-114 cm depth).",

Digital video was collected in September 2014 in the mouth of the Columbia River, USA, as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program contribution to the Office of Naval Research funded River and Inlets Dynamics experiment (RIVET II). Still images were extracted from the underwater video footage whenever the camera was resting on the sediment bed and individual sediment grains were visible and in focus. The images were used to calculate the calibration curve through auto-correlation regressed against the results of laboratory-determined median grain size (D50) of the grab samples (Barnard, 2007), provided in an accompanying .csv file.",

This portion of the data release presents physical characteristics and percent cover data from vegetation plots sampled in China Camp State Park salt marsh (northern San Francisco Bay) in 2015, 2016, and 2017. One-meter quadrats (1m x 1m) were analyzed for percent cover of each vegetation species present, average canopy height, and maximum canopy height. The percent cover was done by visual inspection. A quarter-meter quadrat (0.25m x 0.25m) was then used for stem count and stem diameter measurements. Stem counts were only done for S. foliosa. These quadrats ran along the instruments used to collect sediment and hydrodynamic data, which is described elsewhere in this data release. This survey was conducted on January 23, 2015 (winter conditions) and again on June 6, 2016 (summer conditions). A separate survey was conducted on September 29, 2016 and May 3, 2017, to measure the length, width, and spacing of S. foliosa leaves.

            "description": "This portion of the data release presents topographic data collected at 5 study sites along Elwha River, Washington between 2006 and 2017. Elevations along channel-perpendicular transects were surveyed using a total station and prism rod. Initial geodetic control was established using static global positioning system (GPS) occupations. A total station was subsequently used to expand and maintain the survey control network at each site. All survey data were referenced to the NAD83 datum, using the UTM, zone 10, coordinate reference system. All elevations were referenced to the NAVD88 vertical datum. Based on repeat measurements of points with known positions, we estimated the horizontal and vertical accuracy of the topographic measurements to be within 2 to 3 cm. Topographic data were collected using a total station using survey layout routines to locate data along the same transects during each survey. Wetted portions of the channel were measured primarily by wading with the survey rod. In several locations where wading was not feasible due to water depth, measurements were not taken or they were made by swimming with the survey rod or by deploying the survey rod from an inflatable kayak (necessary in the thalweg of reach 3 between 2006 and 2011). Although the focus of the surveys was to make repeated measurements of elevations along a transect, some additional topographic measurements were within the reaches off of the transects. Additionally, a small side channel within reach 2 was surveyed from 2006 to 2008 along transects perpendicular to that channel and along the channel’s thalweg. Two series of figures are provided to aid with visualizing the channel cross-section data. The first series, labeled “Elwha_CrossSectionPlots_FallSurveys_.png”, shows the channel cross-section profiles from the annual fall surveys, plotted for each transect and each reach. The second series, labeled “Elwha_CrossSectionPlots_Grid_FallSurveys_.png”, shows the channel cross-section profiles from the annual fall surveys for each reach, with each survey date and transect on a separate set of axes to provide a better means of viewing cross-section changes between survey dates (note that Reach 1B was not plotted this way because it was surveyed less frequently).",

Starting in 1963, the USGS acquired marine heat flow data and coincident sediment cores at sites in Canada Basin, Nautilus Basin, Mendeleev Ridge, and Alpha Ridge as the ice island drifted in the Amerasian Basin. Radiogenic heat content in sediments can be an important contributor to measured heat flow. The USGS therefore measured radiogenic heat content in sediments recovered at 26 of the attempted/successful heat flow measurement sites using the laboratory methods available at the time. This dataset reports the measured radiogenic heat values and converts them to modern (SI) units.",

We used five species distribution models (SDM) including Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Tree, Maxent, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and ensembles to develop the present day distributions of the species based on climate-driven models alone. We then projected future distributions of the species using data from four climate models: Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM2-ES), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 5 (MIROC5), and Max Planck Institute Earth System Model, low resolution (MPI-ESM-LR). We ran the climate models according to two greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Datasets in this file are the results for models RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for the years 2050 and 2070. It shows a comparison of ensembles of suitable bioclimatic conditions between present day and future day. The dataset shows areas where ensembles agree and suitable conditions are stable (stable represented in green), future ensemble projects new suitable conditions (gain represented in yellow), present ensemble may be converted to unsuitable in the future (loss represented in red), and areas where conditions are unsuitable in the future (non represented in gray).",

These new techniques are particularly useful for data collection of coastal systems, which requires high temporal and spatial resolution datasets. The U.S. Geological Survey worked in collaboration with members of the Marine Biological Laboratory and Woods Hole Analytics at Black Beach, in Falmouth, Massachusetts to explore scientific research demands on UAS technology for topographic and habitat mapping applications. This project explored the application of consumer-grade UAS platforms as a cost-effective alternative to lidar and aerial/satellite imagery to support coastal studies requiring high-resolution elevation or remote sensing data. A small UAS was used to capture low-altitude photographs and GPS devices were used to survey reference points. These data were processed in an SfM workflow to create an elevation point cloud, an orthomosaic image, and a digital elevation model.",

Given this increasing need to forecast sea-level rise effects on barrier islands in the near and long terms, we are developing Bayesian networks to evaluate and to forecast the cascading effects of sea-level rise on shoreline change, barrier island state, and piping plover habitat availability.

            "description": "As part of a larger investigation to understand groundwater-surface water interactions in Greenwich Bay, Rhode Island, a geophysical survey was conducted from a small research boat on 14-15 May 2009. The specific research objective was to gain an improved understanding of the role of direct groundwater discharge in delivery of excess nitrogen to the bay, which may have contributed to the development of low-oxygen conditions in waters of the bay and associated fish kills. Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values.

This data release provides results for flow-through permeability, consolidation, and direct shear measurements made on fine-grained seal sediment from Site NGHP-02-08 offshore eastern India. The sediment was collected in a pressure core from the Krishna-Godavari Basin during the 2015 Indian National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 2 (NGHP-02). Gas hydrate is a crystalline solid that forms naturally in the sediment of certain marine and permafrost environments where pressure is relatively high (equivalent to the pressure measured at ~300 meters water depth or more) and temperature is relatively low (but generally above freezing). The concentration of methane can be high enough to make certain gas hydrate occurrences potentially relevant as energy resources. To extract methane from gas hydrate, the in situ formation (generally a coarse-grained, gas-hydrate-bearing sediment interval) can be depressurized by drawing pore water out through a production well. As the pore pressure falls below the gas hydrate stability limit, the solid gas hydrate breaks down, releasing gas and water that migrate toward the production well for collection. How effectively the production well can depressurize the gas-hydrate-bearing interval depends on how permeable the overlying seal sediment is. If the seal is permeable, depressurizing the reservoir to extract methane causes water to flow out of the seal and into the reservoir. This can limit the ability of the production well to maintain the low reservoir pressure required to break down gas.",

The activity dataset contains daily telemetry records for 218 adult female walruses tracked for periods of 7 to 104 days during 2008-2014, in the Chukchi Sea. Records include the number of hours the walrus was in the water, number of hours the walrus was foraging, study area region where the walrus was located, depths of the foraging locations, and the proportion of the region covered by sea ice. The movement dataset contains telemetry records for 94 of these walruses, giving the dates they moved from one region to another, and the date of the beginning of minimum ice period for that year. The projected-ice dataset contains daily projections of ice conditions in the study area regions derived from 7 general circulation models of future ice availability for mid-century (2045-2054) and late-century (2090-2099) time periods. The movement and activity datasets were developed to model walrus activity and movement as functions of sea ice conditions. The projected-ice dataset was developed to provide input for those models to forecast future walrus activity and movement. Forecasting autumn body condition requires linkage to bioenergetics models.",

Bathymetry data were collected using four personal watercraft (PWCs) equipped with single-beam sonar systems and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The sonar systems consisted of an Odom Echotrac CV-100 single-beam echosounder and 200 kHz transducer with a 9-degree beam angle. Raw acoustic backscatter returns were digitized by the echosounder with a vertical resolution of 1.25 cm. Depths from the echosounders were computed using sound velocity profiles measured using a YSI CastAway CTD during the survey. Positioning of the survey vessels was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using Trimble R7 GNSS receivers. Output from the GNSS receivers and sonar systems were combined in real time on the PWC by a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing PWC operators to navigate along survey lines at speeds of 2 to 3 m/s. Survey-grade positions of the PWCs were achieved with a single-base station and differential post-processing. Positioning data from the GNSS receivers were post-processed using Waypoint Grafnav to apply differential corrections from a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. Bathymetric data were merged with post-processed positioning data and spurious soundings were removed using a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) programmed with the computer program MATLAB. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 10 cm. The final point data from the PWCs are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system.",

            "description": "Low-altitude (80 and 100 meters above ground level) digital images were taken over an area of the Plum Island Estuary and Parker River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Massachusetts using 3DR Solo unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) on February 27, 2018. These images were collected as part of an effort to document marsh stability over time and quantify sediment movement using UAS technology. Each UAS was equipped with either a Ricoh GRII digital camera for natural color photos, used to produce digital elevation models and ortho images, or a MicaSense RedEdge multi-spectral camera that captures five specific bands of the visible spectrum (blue, green, red, red edge, and near-infrared), which can be used to classify vegetation. The MicaSense camera covered a smaller subsection of the same polygonal area of the marsh that the Ricoh imaged. Some photographs contain black and white targets used as ground control points (GCPs), which were surveyed by a field crew with a high-precision Real Time Kinematic Global Position System. This data release includes the original images from both cameras, as well as a csv file containing the latitude and longitude coordinates, in Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 19N referenced to the North American Datum of 1983, of the ground control points needed to complete any photogrammetry projects using the original photographs, and GPS transect points used to evaluate the photogrammetry products created.",

Physical bedload sampling by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for system calibration took place during November, 2012; March, May, and June 2013; and April 2014 at the Diversion Weir gauge (Magirl and others, 2015). Early in water year 2016 (year 5) the river formed an avulsion channel across the floodplain on river left, preventing a complete measurement of bedload passing the Diversion Weir gauge. As a result, bedload for water year 2016 (year 5 of the larger study) was estimated using a discharge rating curve to obtain monthly values.",

            "description": "In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. Field activity information for this cruise is available on-line through the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geoscience Data System https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2005-004-FA.",

The data were collected in collaboration with the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary and will aid research on the ecology of fish and invertebrate species that inhabit the region. Sediment samples were collected aboard the Sanctuary’s research vessel, R/V Auk at 679 locations on and near Stellwagen Bank using a customized Van Veen grab sampler integrated into the USGS SEABed Observation and Sampling System (SEABOSS). The SEABOSS, equipped with a video camera, was deployed from the Auk and allowed to drift for a shore period of time approximately 1 meter from the sea floor collecting video imagery of the sea floor. The SEABOSS drift typically culminated in the collection of a sediment sample used for grain-size analysis. Biological specimens were collected from the sediment, if present, and retained by scientists at teh SBNMS in Scituate, Massachusetts.",

The U.S. Geological Survey conducted cruises during the summers of 2014 and 2015 to map the inner continental shelf of the Delmarva Peninsula using geophysical and sampling techniques to define the geologic framework that governs coastal system evolution at storm-event and longer timescales. Geophysical data collected during the cruises include swath bathymetric, sidescan sonar, chirp and boomer seismic reflection profiles, grab sample and bottom photograph data.

            "description": "In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats. Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire. In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay. In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. Field activity information for this cruise is available on-line through the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geoscience Data System https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fa=2005-004-FA.",

Three replicate benthic samples were collected at 23 sites to total 69 samples in Year 1.   The samples were immediately sieved over a 0.5 mm mesh screen.  The residue remaining on the screen was fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in seawater, buffered with sodium borate and containing Rose Bengal to stain organisms.  A fourth grab was collected for sediment analysis. Sediment for grain size analysis was wet-sieved through a 63μm-mesh sieve in distilled water with dispersant to disaggregate and separate the silt and clay fraction from the sand-sized fraction.  Silt and clay mass was determined by drying a known volume of the water-particle mixture passing through the sieve.  The sand fraction was dried and then sieved into the following size fractions: &amp;lt;63 µm (silt), 63-125 µm (very fine sand), 125-250 µm (fine sand), 250-500 µm (medium sand), 500-1000 µm (coarse sand), &amp;gt;1000 µm (very coarse sand).  Each fraction was weighed. The mass of the &amp;lt;4φ fraction was further analyzed using a Spectrex model PC-2000 laser particle counter (Spectrex Corporation, Redwood City, CA) Counts of particles were obtained corresponding to these additional size categories: 5φ (4-8 µm very fine silt), and 6φ (16-31 µm, medium silt), 7φ (8-16 µm, fine silt), 8 φ ( 4-8 µm, very fine silt), and 9 φ (2-4 µm, clay). Particle counts were converted to mass by multiplying the fractional volume percent in each size category by the total mass of the &amp;lt;4φ fraction determined during wet sieving.",

These images were collected as part of an effort to document marsh stability over time and quantify sediment movement using UAS technology. Each UAS was equipped with either a Ricoh GRII digital camera for natural color photos, used to produce digital elevation models and ortho images, or a MicaSense RedEdge multi-spectral camera that captures five specific bands of the visible spectrum (blue, green, red, red edge, and near-infrared), which can be used to classify vegetation. The MicaSense camera covered a smaller subsection of the same polygonal area of the marsh that the Ricoh imaged. Some photographs contain black and white targets used as ground control points (GCPs), which were surveyed by a field crew with a high-precision Real Time Kinematic Global Position System. This data release includes the original images from both cameras, as well as a csv file containing the latitude and longitude coordinates, in Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 19 referenced to the North American Datum of 1983, of the ground control points needed to complete any photogrammetry projects using the original photographs, and GPS transect points used to evaluate the photogrammetry products created.",

            "description": "Low-altitude (80-100 meters above ground level) digital images were obtained from a camera mounted on a 3DR Solo quadcopter, a small unmanned aerial system (UAS), along the Lake Ontario shoreline in New York during July 2017. These data were collected to document and monitor effects of high lake levels, including shoreline erosion, inundation, and property damage in the vicinity of Sodus Bay, New York. This data release includes images tagged with locations determined from the UAS GPS; tables with updated estimates of camera positions and attitudes based on the photogrammetric reconstruction; tables listing locations of the base stations, ground control points, and transect points; geolocated, RGB-colored point clouds; orthomosaic images; and digital elevation models for each of the survey regions. Collection of these data was supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the State of New York Departments of State and Environmental Conservation, and the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program and was conducted under USGS field activity number 2017-042-FA.",

Grain-size measurements were made at four to six transects per site using a 0.5 by 0.5 m sampling frame, with 100 counts per transect. Each transect was defined by coordinates on the left and right sides of the river, and grain sizes were measured at points between those endpoint coordinates (see accompanying file at https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a271f8ce4b03852bafc8eaa for transect endpoint coordinates). Grain-size diameters were measured using a gravelometer, where we recorded the largest sieve size on the gravelometer that an individual particle did not pass through, similar to recording the percent retained in standard sieve analyses. We shifted these grain-size values to the next size class up in this spreadsheet, with the data being analogous to the percent passing in sieve analyses.",

Approximately 130 linear kilometers of subbottom (seismic-reflection) and 234-kilohertz interferometric sonar (bathymetric and backscatter) data were collected along with sediment samples, sea floor photographs, and (or) video at 26 sites within the geophysical survey area. Sediment grab samples were collected at 19 of the 26 sampling sites and video and (or) photographic imagery of the sea floor were taken at all 26 sites.

Each salamander found will be hand-captured and placed in a new, clean plastic bag with a small amount of water to keep their skin moist. Salamanders will then be measured with calipers for snout-vent length, tail length, and cranial length and width. An approximately 5 mm piece of tissue will be removed from the tail tip for use in genetic analyses. To minimize handling stress, salamander measurements and tissue collection will take place in the field, adjacent to capture sites, and salamanders will be released at their point of capture immediately afterwards.",

In 2014, following an 8-year period with 7 below-normal to critically-dry water years, the bioenergetic model TRUEMET was used to assess the impacts of drought on wintering waterfowl habitat and bioenergetics in the Central Valley of California. The goal of the study was to assess whether available foraging habitats could provide enough food to support waterfowl populations (ducks and geese) under a variety of climate and population level scenarios. This information could then be used by managers to adapt their waterfowl habitat management plans to drought conditions. The study area spanned the Central Valley and included the Sacramento Valley in the north, the San Joaquin Valley in the south, and Suisun Marsh and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta) east of San Francisco Bay. The data set consists of two foraging guilds (ducks and geese/swans) and five forage types: harvested corn, rice (flooded), rice (unflooded), wetland invertebrates and wetland moist soil seeds. For more background on the data set, see Petrie et al. in review.",

Fish heads and eyeballs were sent overnight to U.S. Geological Survey Wetland and Aquatic Research Center for ploidy analysis. Field and laboratory standard operating procedures were established and followed. Fish lengths, fish weights, and eyeball weights were obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s feral carp ploidy program for grass carp and black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) and the Ohio grass carp. Internal 2µm or 4µm bead standards were used in establishing nuclear sizes from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), known diploid (n=20) and triploid (n=20) carp blood, as well as cells derived from eyeballs from intercepted carp. Cells from the fish eyes were obtained from an ocular blood vessel as well as the vitreous humor. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide, internal bead standards were included, and three replicate tubes per fish were analyzed by flow cytometry. The external DNA content control was fresh or cryopreserve blood from tilapia, with a diploid genome size of 2.40 pg. This standard protocol uses nuclear size as well as DNA content for reliably discriminating ploidy of interstate hauled grass carp.",

These new techniques are particularly useful for data collection of coastal systems, which requires high temporal and spatial resolution datasets. The U.S. Geological Survey worked in collaboration with members of the Marine Biological Laboratory and Woods Hole Analytics at Black Beach, in Falmouth, Massachusetts to explore scientific research demands on UAS technology for topographic and habitat mapping applications. This project explored the application of consumer-grade UAS platforms as a cost-effective alternative to lidar and aerial/satellite imagery to support coastal studies requiring high-resolution elevation or remote sensing data. A small UAS was used to capture low-altitude photographs and GPS devices were used to survey reference points. These data were processed in an SfM workflow to create an elevation point cloud, an orthomosaic image, and a digital elevation model.",

            "description": "This portion of the USGS data release presents eelgrass distribution and bathymetry data derived from acoustic surveys of the Nisqually River delta, Washington in 2017 (USGS Field Activity Number 2017-614-FA). Eelgrass and bathymetry data were collected from the R/V George Davidson equipped with a single-beam sonar system and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. The sonar system consisted of a Biosonics DT-X single-beam echosounder and 420 kHz transducer with a 6-degree beam angle. Depths from the echosounder were computed using sound velocity data measured using a YSI CastAway CTD during the survey. Positioning of the survey vessel was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using a Trimble R7 GNSS receiver and Trimble Zephyr Model 2 antenna operating in real time kinematic (RTK) mode. Differential corrections were transmitted by a VHF radio to the GNSS receiver on the survey vessel at 1-Hz from a GNSS base station placed on a nearby benchmark with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983 (CORS96 realization). Output from the GNSS and sonar systems were combined in real time by the Biosonics DT-X deck unit and output to a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing the vessel operator to navigate along predefined survey lines spaced at 25-50 m intervals alongshore at speeds of 2-3 m/s. Acoustic backscatter data were analyzed using a custom graphical user interface that implements a signal processing algorithm applied to each sonar sounding that differentiates and extracts the location of the seafloor apart from the presence of vegetation (Stevens and others, 2008). Individual acoustic returns along a survey line were grouped into packets of ten, and eelgrass percent cover was calculated as the fractional percent of acoustic returns that were classified as vegetated within each group, resulting in an estimate of percent cover every 4 to 5 m (depending on the vessel speed). Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 5 cm. The point data are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in Cartesian coordinates using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Zone 10 north, meters coordinate system.",

Still images were extracted from the underwater video footage whenever the camera was resting on the sediment bed and individual sediment grains were visible and in focus. The images are used to calculate the median grain size through an auto-correlation method (Barnard and other 2007), and are provided in an accompanying .csv file.",

            "description": "This data release provides seafloor-characteristics point data across the Gulf of Alaska, as digitized directly from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) smooth sheets published from 1892 to 2001, and archived at the National Geophysics Data Center (NGDC). Geo-rectification and digitization methods were adapted from Zimmermann and Benson (2013). Each location includes information for the smooth sheet number (H#####), a unique site number location, latitude, longitude, collection date, seafloor notation, and the translation of the notation. Unique site numbers were assigned randomly to each notation on a smooth sheet, starting at “_0”. Examples of seafloor notations include: rk (= rock); bu C (= blue clay); hrd (= hard); fne S (= fine sand); Co (= coral) or similar codes; the full code key is given in the Department of Commerce and Department of Defense Chart 1 (2013). In some cases, a diagrammatic indication of the seafloor character is used on the smooth sheet, such as a “”. During digitization, the corresponding value given in “Chart 1” is assigned to the location; in this case, “” denotes “rk” or “rock”. Distribution of NOS seafloor-characteristics data across the Gulf of Alaska varies widely: nearer the shoreline, data are more densely distributed; on the mid and outer continental shelf, data are more sparsely spaced. The cited locations of the points were adjusted as necessary in GIS to match the location on the geo-rectified smooth sheet in GIS as projected in North American Datum of 1983. NOAA has published the companion regional bathymetric data and its derivatives and sediment characteristics data for Cook Inlet and areas of the Aleutian Islands at http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/bathymetry/. The project was funded through the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, and Alaska Fisheries Science Center Interagency Agreement AKC-119 (May 2012).

The landscapes include ice-rich polygonal ground found on basin uplands, as well as bluffs and lake edges. At each site a visual description of soil type and texture was performed, and a permafrost probe was used to determine a ‘depth to refusal’. Given that the soils are mostly fine-grained and there were no obvious rock strikes, we believe that ‘depth to refusal’ indicates the thaw depth. Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined in most locations using a Guelph Permeameter.",

Critical sediment properties, such as compressibility, can change in response to pore-fluid chemistry changes, particularly if the sediment contains appreciable concentrations of fine-grained materials.

            "name": "Dependence of sedimentation behavior on pore-fluid chemistry for sediment collected offshore South Korea during the Second Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate Expedition, UBGH2",
            "description": "One goal of Korea’s Second Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate Expedition, UBGH2, is to examine geotechnical properties of the marine sediment associated with methane gas hydrate occurrences found offshore eastern Korea in the Ulleung Basin, East Sea. Methane gas hydrate is a naturally occurring crystalline solid that sequesters methane in individual molecular cages formed by a lattice of water molecules. Offshore Korea, gas hydrate is found in thin, coarse-grained sediment layers that are interbedded with fine-grained sediment. Methane gas hydrate is a potential energy resource, but whether extracting methane from gas hydrate in these layered marine environments is technically and economically viable remains an open research topic as of 2019. This data release provides insight about a poorly quantified aspect of this process: the reaction of fine-grained sediment particles (fines) to the change in pore water chemistry that occurs when methane is extracted from gas hydrate. Fines are an issue for production because they can get resuspended in the flow of fluid and gas toward an extraction well. As fines move, they can cluster and subsequently clog pore throats in the sediment, reducing permeability (which controls how easily methane can flow toward the extraction well). The type of fine-grained particle and the chemistry of the surrounding pore water are the two main factors in determining the cluster structure (the size and fabric of the cluster) and the cluster formation and settling rates. Data in this study provide insight into both factors. Fine particles interact with each other primarily in response to electrical forces, and changes in pore water chemistry can significantly alter how those forces are communicated between particles. In marine systems, in situ pore water is an electrically conductive brine. As gas hydrate dissociates, however, fresh water is released along with the methane, making the pore water less conductive. Depending on the type of fine-grained particles involved, the pore water chemistry change enhances or diminishes the clustering and changes the rates at which the clusters form and settle. For this data release, specimens from the UBGH2 expedition were observed during sedimentation (settling) tests in pore fluids of differing chemistry. The results included in this data release can (1) provide insight into the types of fines present, which can be difficult to quantify if using the more standard x-ray diffraction method for identifying fines and (2) indicate whether the in situ fines are likely to increase or decrease their capacity to clog pore throats as the pore water transitions from higher to lower salinity during gas hydrate dissociation.",

(2017) were used to assess den entry and emergence dates. The algorithm used identified periods in which temperature remained consistently above a temperature threshold. As such, users of these data should be aware that bear behavior can affect den entrance and exit date. If a bear moves in and out of a den frequently, the algorithm identifies that bear as not denning. Den substrate was determined by examining satellite locations from collars during the identified denning period and classify dens as occurring on landfast ice, sea ice, or land. This data set also includes direct observations of females post-den emergence including whether or not she was accompanied by cubs as an indicator of reproductive success.",

Since the 1980s, Chinese geologists have devoted a large-scale exploration and research effort to the deposits. As a result, there are more than 20 million oz of proven Au reserves in sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in P.R. China. Additional estimated and inferred resources are present in over 160 deposits and occurrences, which are undergoing exploration. This makes China second to Nevada in contained ounces of Au in Carlin-type deposits.

We collected all peer reviewed academic articles containing the keywords “landscape” and “perception” on the web of science resulting in 3497 records. To eliminate studies not directly addressing landscape perception we filtered out medical journal articles (n=1211). We also chose to limit our assessment to journals directly concerned with the landscape perception topic, omitting those with fewer than 5 articles pertaining to these keywords (n=1044). The abstract and title of the remaining articles (n=1242) were further scanned to discard irrelevant studies and evaluate specific methods and techniques employed resulting in a total of 584 articles. The list also includes some relevant information pertaining to the article, including the article abstract, methods used in the study, the location of the study, and whether or not the article considers change in perceptions over time.",

Data for this study were obtained from a combination of unpublished data and published literature values. We find that although warming increases soil respiration rates, there is limited evidence for a shifting respiration response with experimental warming. We also note a universal decline in the temperature sensitivity of respiration at soil temperatures &amp;gt;25°C. This dataset includes 3817 observations, from control (n=1812), first (i.e., lowest or sole) level warming (n=1812), second (higher) level warming (n=179, four studies), and third-level warming (n=14, one study). Experiment locations ranged from 33.5 to 68.4 degrees N latitude and the duration of warming at experiments ranged from &amp;lt;1 to 22 years (average 5.1 years). Depths of soil temperature (1-10 cm) and moisture measurements (5-30) ranged across studies, but were always consistent between warmed and control plots within a particular study. Each site was classified into a particular biome (grassland, northern shrubland (i.e., peatlands and heathlands), southern shrubland (i.e., Mediterranean or sub-tropical shrublands)), tundra, desert, meadow, temperate agriculture, temperate forest and boreal forest) by the associated principal investigator (PI).",

            "description": "A critical question for assessing global greenhouse gas budgets is how much of the methane that escapes from seafloor cold seep sites to the overlying water column eventually crosses the sea-air interface and reaches the atmosphere. The issue is particularly important in Arctic Ocean waters since rapid warming there increases the likelihood that gas hydrate–an ice-like form of methane and water stable at particular pressure and temperature conditions within marine sediments–will break down and release its methane to the overlying ocean. Some researchers have even proposed the possibility of an Arctic methane catastrophe characterized by wholesale breakdown of gas hydrates in marine sediments and release of the methane to the atmosphere as climate warms. This dataset collected on the West Spitsbergen margin during U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program Field Activity 2014-013-FA, which was carried out in conjunction with the University of Tromso and the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel on the R/V Helmer Hanssen, records 30-second-gridded methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in near-surface seawater and the atmospheric marine boundary layer, the carbon-13 isotopic composition of methane and carbon dioxide in the near-surface waters, and also environmental parameters (e.g., seawater salinity, wind speed, water and air temperatures). The results of calculations required to determine the sea-air flux of methane and carbon dioxide are also provided.",

These new techniques are particularly useful for data collection of coastal systems, which requires high temporal and spatial resolution datasets. The U.S. Geological Survey worked in collaboration with members of the Marine Biological Laboratory and Woods Hole Analytics at Black Beach, in Falmouth, Massachusetts to explore scientific research demands on UAS technology for topographic and habitat mapping applications. This project explored the application of consumer-grade UAS platforms as a cost-effective alternative to lidar and aerial/satellite imagery to support coastal studies requiring high-resolution elevation or remote sensing data. A small UAS was used to capture low-altitude photographs and GPS devices were used to survey reference points. These data were processed in an SfM workflow to create an elevation point cloud, an orthomosaic image, and a digital elevation model.",

The location of these marshes within protected embayments and the absence of large rivers on Cape Cod result in minimal sediment supply and a dominance of organic matter contribution to sediment peat. Age models based on 210-lead and 137-cesium were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed over the past century. The continuous rate of supply age model was used to age date 11 cores (10 low marsh and 1 high marsh) across four salt marshes. Both vertical accretion rates and carbon burial increased from 1900 to the years of collection, 2013 and 2014. Elevation of the marsh surface was measured to evaluate where the marsh falls within the current tidal frame. The historic marsh surface elevation was then reconstructed from the calculated age of each depth interval and its elevation, assuming that elevations within this shallow zone (less than 30 centimeters) have been preserved for the past century.",

            "description": "Groundwater data were collected in the spring and fall of 2008 from three sites representing different geological settings and biogeochemical conditions within the surficial glacial aquifer of Long Island, NY. Investigations were designed to examine the extent to which average vadose zone thickness in contributing watersheds controlled biogeochemical conditions and processes, including dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (Eh), dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), and microbial dinitrogen (N2) production. Greatest N2 production was observed at the south shore of Long Island, which is characterized by a thin vadose zone, low DO and Eh, and relatively high DOC. Limited N2 production occurred at the north shore of Long Island, which is characterized by a thick vadose zone, higher DO, higher Eh, and lower DOC. Our results show that vadose zone thickness exerts an important control on the extent of microbial N2 production in aquifers that lack a significant supply of sediment-bound reducing potential. We interpret heterotrophic denitrification to be the primary driver of N2 production in the present study, while acknowledging that anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) likely plays an unquantified role as well.",

Sharp to explore the geology, chemistry, ecology, physics, and oceanography of sea-floor methane seeps and water column gas plumes on the northern U.S. Atlantic margin between the Baltimore and Keller Canyons. Split-beam and multibeam echo sounders and a chirp subbottom profiler were deployed during the cruises to map water column backscatter, sea-floor bathymetry and backscatter, and subsurface stratigraphy associated with known and undiscovered sea-floor methane seeps. The first cruise, known as the Interagency Mission for Methane Research on Seafloor Seeps and designated as field activity 2017-001-FA, was conducted from May 4 to May 11, 2017, and acquired geophysical data to support remotely operated vehicle exploration of seep sites using the Global Explorer, which is operated by Oceaneering International, Inc. Geophysical operations during cruise 2017-002-FA from August 25 to September 6, 2017, were also focused on mapping water column methane plumes, sea-floor seep sites, and subseafloor strata, but primarily supported conductivity, temperature, and depth instrument deployment, surface-water methane-concentration mapping, and water-sampling operations as part of a collaborative study with the University of Rochester of the effect of methane seepage on ocean water biogeochemistry. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research partially sponsored cruise 2017-001-FA, and the U.S. Department of Energy partially sponsored both cruises.",

Each photograph was qualitatively characterized as one of six categories: (1) base, or no sediment; (2) low sediment; (3) medium sediment; (4) high sediment; (5) turbid; or (6) kelp. For base conditions, no sediment was present on the seafloor. Low sediment conditions were characterized by a light dusting of sediment; medium sediment conditions were characterized by a layer of sediment that covered all rock surfaces but did not obscure the relief of the seafloor; high sediment conditions were characterized by a layer of sediment that covered all rock surfaces and obscured the relief of the seafloor. During turbid conditions, suspended sediment in the water column obscured the view of the seafloor, and during kelp conditions, blades of kelp covered the camera lens, blocking our view of the seafloor.",

            "description": "One goal of the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program’s NGHP-02 expedition was to examine the geomechanical response of marine sediment to the extraction of methane from gas hydrate found offshore eastern India in the Bay of Bengal. Methane gas hydrate is a naturally occurring crystalline solid that sequesters methane in individual molecular cages in a lattice of water molecules. Methane gas hydrate is a potential energy resource, but whether extracting methane from gas hydrate in the marine subsurface is technically and economically viable remains an open research topic as of 2018. This data release provides insight about a poorly quantified aspect of this process: the reaction of fine-grained sediment particles (fines) to the change in pore water chemistry that occurs when methane is extracted from gas hydrate. Fines are an issue for production because they can get resuspended in the flow of fluid and gas toward the extraction well. As fines move, they can cluster and subsequently clog pore throats in the sediment, reducing permeability (which controls how easily methane can flow toward the extraction well). There are two main factors in determining the cluster structure (the size and fabric of the cluster) and the cluster formation and settling rates: the type of fine-grained particle and the chemistry of the surrounding pore water. Data in this study provide insight into both factors. Fine particles interact with each other primarily in response to electrical forces, and changes in pore water chemistry can significantly alter how those forces are communicated between particles. In marine systems, in situ pore water is an electrically conductive brine. As gas hydrate dissociates, however, fresh water is released along with the methane, making the pore water less conductive. Depending on the type of fine-grained particles involved, the pore water chemistry change enhances or diminishes the clustering and changes the rates at which the clusters form and settle. For this data release, specimens from the NGHP-02 expedition are observed during sedimentation (settling) tests in pore fluids of differing chemistry. The results included in this data release can (1) provide insight into the types of fines present, which can be difficult to quantify if using the more standard x-ray diffraction method for identifying fines and (2) indicate whether the in situ fines are likely to increase or decrease their capacity to clog pore throats as the pore water transitions from higher to lower salinity during gas hydrate dissociation.",

Topographic profiles were collected by walking along survey lines with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers mounted on backpacks. Prior to data collection, vertical distances between the GNSS antennas and the ground were measured using a tape measure. Hand-held data collectors were used to log raw data and display navigational information allowing surveyors to navigate survey lines spaced at 100- to 1000-m intervals along the beach. Profiles were surveyed from the landward edge of the study area (either the base of a bluff, engineering structure, or just landward of the primary dune) over the beach foreshore, to wading depth on the same series of transects as nearshore bathymetric surveys that were conducted during the same time period. Additional topographic data were collected between survey lines in some areas with an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) equipped with a GNSS receiver to constrain the elevations and alongshore extent of major morphological features. Positioning data from the survey platforms were referenced to a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Differential corrections from the GNSS base stations to the survey platforms were either applied in real-time with a VHF radio link, or post-processed using Trimble Business Center software. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the topographic measurements is 4 cm. The final point data are provided in comma-separated text format and are projected in Cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system.",

Additional topographic data were collected between survey lines in some areas with an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) equipped with a GNSS receiver to constrain the elevations and alongshore extent of major morphological features. Positioning data from the survey platforms were referenced to a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Differential corrections from the GNSS base stations to the survey platforms were either applied in real-time with a VHF radio link, or post-processed using Trimble Business Center software.

The bathymetry was collected from approximately the confluence of Driftwood and Flatrock rivers, downstream to the confluence of Haw Creek. Hydrographic data were collected using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) with integrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). Data were collected as the surveying vessel traversed the river, approximately perpendicular to the velocity vectors at 55 cross sections which were spaced 200 feet apart along the river. Additional cross sections were collected upstream and downstream of the low-head dam in Columbus, Indiana, as well. Data collection software integrated and stored the depth and DGPS data from the ADCP. Real-time kinematic GPS was collected at each cross section recording the water-surface elevation. Data processing required computer software to extract bathymetry data from the raw data files and to compile the information. The final csv file contains columns of Longitude and Latitude in degrees WGS84, and Elevation in feet NAVD88.",

            "description": "This data product contains avian habitat data collected on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA, during 21 May – 10 June 2012. We conducted replicated 10-min surveys at 111 points located along 9 transects occurring over gradients of physical and biotic habitat conditions and recorded observations of individual birds identified to species. Survey points, or sites, were located approximately 500 m apart and observations of birds were limited to a maximum distance of 250 m to prevent double counting. We visited each survey site 2–3 times and assumed community closure within the survey period. Mean interval (±SD) between site-specific surveys was 5.8 ± 2.4 days. We measured 13 vegetative characteristics at 10 subsampling points associated with each bird survey location during 26 June – 11 July 2012. Five subsampling plots were located along each of two 20-m transects with random orientation (0–359 degrees). One transect originated at the bird survey point, and the other at a point selected randomly within 250 m of the bird survey point. At each subsampling point, we estimated overlapping coverages within six vegetation classes, including alder (Alnus spp.), dwarf birch (Betula spp.), ericaceous shrubs (e.g., Empetrum, Vaccinium spp.), herbaceous, lichen (e.g., Cladonia spp.), and willow (Salix spp.) using a 0.5-m2 quadrat frame, and recorded the height of the tallest plant of each type within the sampling frame. We recorded visual obstruction (VOR), an index of vegetation of height and density, at each subsampling point measured from a distance of 2 m and at a height of 0.5 m.

            "description": "Fine-grained sediments, or “fines,” are nearly ubiquitous in natural sediments, even in the predominantly coarse-grained sediments that host gas hydrates. Fines within these sandy sediments can be mobilized and subsequently clog flow pathways while methane is being extracted from gas hydrate as an energy resource. Using two-dimensional (2D) micromodels to test the conditions in which clogging occurs provides insights for choosing production operation parameters that optimize methane recovery in the field. During methane extraction, several processes can alter the mobility and clogging potential of fines: (1) fluid flow as the formation is depressurized to release methane from gas hydrate, (2) shifting pore-fluid chemistry as pore-fluid brine freshens as a result of pure water released from dissociating gas hydrate, and (3) the migration of gas/water interfaces, which are created as gas evolves from dissociating gas hydrate. In this study, 2D micromodel experiments were conducted on a selection of pure fines, natural sediments, pore-fluids, and micromodel pore-throat sizes to evaluate fines migration and changes in clogging behavior resulting from methane gas production and pore-water freshening during hydrate dissociation. Additionally, tests were run with and without an invading gas phase (carbon dioxide) to test the importance of a moving meniscus on fines mobility and clogging. The endmember fine particles chosen for this research included silica silt, mica, calcium carbonate, diatoms, kaolinite, illite, and bentonite (primarily made of montmorillonite). The pore fluids included deionized water, sodium chloride brine (2 molar concentration), and carbon dioxide gas. The microfluidic pore models, used as porous media analogs, were fabricated with pore-throat widths of 20, 40, 60 and 100 micrometers to cover the range of anticipated pore throat sizes sampled during NGHP-02. This dataset provides a clogging diagram showing how grain size, fines concentration, pore fluid chemistry and mobile interfaces define the clogging behavior of the pure fines. This fundamental properties diagram helps interpret the clogging behavior of three natural samples also tested for this dataset. The natural samples were collected during NGHP-02. This research shows that in addition to the expected dependence of clogging on the ratio of particle-to-pore-throat size, pore-fluid chemistry is also an important factor because the interaction between a particular type of fine and pore fluid influences that fine’s capacity to cluster, clump together, and thereby increase the effective particle size relative to the pore-throat width. The presence of a moving gas/fluid meniscus increases the clogging potential regardless of fine type because the advancing meniscus tends to gather and concentrate the fines.",

            "description": "Collections were made on Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge and Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service attributed specimens with information on the date (month, day, year) and collection location (coordinates).  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Pollinating Insects Research Unit, Bee Biology and Systematics Laboratory, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA (hereafter BBSL) made final identification of each specimen, and accession of specimens into their larger museum collection followed identification.  The BBSL subsequently attributed specimen records with information such as species name and associated taxonomy.  The BBSL also assigned each specimen a unique identification number (catalog number) so physical specimens can readily be associated with electronic data records.Information in this dataset was exported from the BBSL larger dataset, thus it is the subset of data that pertains to the Muleshoe and Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge specimens.  The BBSL uses Darwin Core terms to describe data fields for each record.  The definitions below are taken directly from the Darwin Core Terms quick reference guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm), although some have been modified to more accurately describe information attributed to specimens in this data set.  Users of the dataset should refer to Darwin Core terms reference guide if more clarity is needed about a given field, or how it might relate to information assembled in other databases.",

Because of continued coastal population growth and the increased threat of coastal erosion, the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) launched the Shoreline Change Project in 1989 to identify erosion-prone areas of the coast. Maps of historic shoreline locations from the mid-1800s to 1978 were produced from multiple data sources, and in 2001, a 1994 shoreline was added to enable the calculation of long- and short-term shoreline change rates. In 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with CZM, delineated an additional oceanfront shoreline using 2007 topographic lidar data and 2008–9 color aerial orthoimagery. Further cooperation between CZM and the USGS resulted in this 2018 update, intended to increase the understanding of coastal erosion and to support coastal management decision making. This update includes beach shorelines, marsh shorelines, and dune metrics, all of which were derived from topographic lidar data. This data release, which is part of the 2018 update, defines the position and elevation of the most seaward dune crest and toe along the Massachusetts coast as derived from 2013–14 lidar data. In the absence of a dune, the peak of the berm or the seaward edge of a bluff, headland, or hard structure (for example, a seawall, road, or parking lot) was chosen as a proxy for the dune crest. Where possible, the dune toe was placed at the base of the proxy feature.",
