This sediment database contains location, description, and texture of samples taken by numerous marine sampling programs. Most of the samples are from the Atlantic Continental Margin of the United States, but some are from as diverse locations as Lake Baikal, Russia, the Hawaiian Islands region, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and Lake Michigan. The database presently contains data for over 27,000 samples, which includes texture data for approximately 3800 samples taken or analyzed by the Atlantic Continental Margin Program (ACMP), a joint U.S. Geological Survey/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution project conducted from 1962 to 1970. As part of the ACMP, some historical data from samples collected between 1955 and 1962 were also incorporated into the dataset.
