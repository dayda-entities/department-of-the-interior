These are data collected from two types of activity sensors housed within collars deployed on female polar bears in the Chukchi and southern Beaufort Seas during the months of July through October between 1989 and 2014. Mercury tip-switches were deployed 1989 to 2009 and accelerometers were deployed 2009-2014. Activity sensor readings were related to habitats used by polar bears as described in the methods below.
