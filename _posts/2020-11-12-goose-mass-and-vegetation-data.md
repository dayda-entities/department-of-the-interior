This data release contains three tables of information from the Colville River Delta, Alaska (CDR): offtake of Carex subspathacea (2012-2014), standing crop of C. subspathacea (2012-2014), and snow goose and black brant gosling mass data (2012-2017). Data were collected as part of the USGS Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative to understand the response of wildlife to rapid physical changes taking place in the Arctic.
