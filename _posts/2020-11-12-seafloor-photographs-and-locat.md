Seafloor photographs were collected by SCUBA divers along pre-determined transects using an underwater digital camera following benthic survey protocols developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park (Marrack and others, 2014; Weijerman and others, 2014) and modeled after the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NPS coral reef survey protocols (Rogers and others, 2001; Brown and others, 2011). This dataset includes seafloor photographs in jpg format, the locations of which are described in the accompanying comma-separated files.
