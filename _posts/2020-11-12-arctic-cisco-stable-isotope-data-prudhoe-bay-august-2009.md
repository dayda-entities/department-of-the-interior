This data set documents the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of age-0 Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis) captured in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in August 2009. The analysis of this data was published in von Biela et al. 2013 (Polar Biology 36:137-146, doi:10.1007/s00300-012-1244-x). All stable isotope results were provided by the University of Alaska Anchorage Environmental and Natural Resources Institute (ENRI) Stable Isotope Laboratory. The Stable Isotope Facility was led by Dr. Jeffery Welker and managed by Brian Cohn at the time of the analysis.
