This portion of the USGS data release presents eelgrass distribution and bathymetry data derived from acoustic surveys of the Nisqually River delta, Washington in 2012 (USGS Field Activity Number D-01-12-PS). Eelgrass and bathymetry data were collected from the R/V George Davidson equipped with a single-beam sonar system and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. The sonar system consisted of a Biosonics DT-X single-beam echosounder and 420 kHz transducer with a 6-degree beam angle. Depths from the echosounder were computed using sound velocity assuming a salinity of 30 psu and temperature of 10 degrees Celsius. Positioning of the survey vessel was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using a Trimble R7 GNSS receiver and Trimble Zephyr Model 2 antenna operating in real time kinematic (RTK) mode. Differential corrections were transmitted by a VHF radio to the GNSS receiver on the survey vessel at 1-Hz from a GNSS base station placed on a nearby benchmark with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983 (CORS96 realization). Output from the GNSS and sonar systems were combined in real time by the Biosonics DT-X deck unit and output to a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing the vessel operator to navigate along predefined survey lines spaced at 25-50 m intervals alongshore at speeds of 2 to 3 m/s. Acoustic backscatter data were analyzed using a custom graphical user interface that implements a signal processing algorithm applied to each sonar sounding that differentiates and extracts the location of the seafloor apart from the presence of vegetation (Stevens and others, 2008). Individual acoustic returns along a survey line were grouped into packets of ten, and eelgrass percent cover was calculated as the fractional percent of acoustic returns that were classified as vegetated within each group, resulting in an estimate of percent cover every 4 to 5 m (depending on the vessel speed). Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 12 cm. The point data are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in Cartesian coordinates using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Zone 10 north, meters coordinate system.
