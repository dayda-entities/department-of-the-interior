This portion of the USGS data release presents single beam bathymetry data collected during surveys performed in the Cache Slough Complex, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California in 2017 and 2018 (USGS Field Activity Numbers 2017-649-FA and 2018-684-FA). Bathymetry data were collected using personal watercraft (PWCs) equipped with single-beam sonar systems and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The final point data from the PWCs are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in cartesian coordinates using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10 North, meters coordinate system.
