Data on alien (non-native) plant species surveys within the boundaries of disturbed sites within Yosemite National Park. Surveys were supplemented by quadrat-based subsampling of some campgrounds, camps, developments and corrals to obtain native/non-native species ratios. Surveys primarily targeted areas of human disturbance, such as campgrounds, corrals, developments, roads, trails and pastures, where alien plant species were most likely to be introduced and dispersed.
