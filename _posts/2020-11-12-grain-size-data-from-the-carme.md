Pebble count data were collected during four summer surveys (2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017) at ten sites along the Carmel River, CA. Grain-size measurements were made at four to six transects per site using a 0.5 by 0.5 m sampling frame, with 100 counts per transect. Each transect was defined by coordinates on the left and right sides of the river, and grain sizes were measured at points between those endpoint coordinates (see accompanying file at https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a271f8ce4b03852bafc8eaa for transect endpoint coordinates). Grain-size diameters were measured using a gravelometer, where we recorded the largest sieve size on the gravelometer that an individual particle did not pass through, similar to recording the percent retained in standard sieve analyses. We shifted these grain-size values to the next size class up in this spreadsheet, with the data being analogous to the percent passing in sieve analyses.
