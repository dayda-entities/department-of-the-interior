Since 2002, the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Centerâs Samples Repository supports research by providing secure storage for geological, biological, and geochemical samples; maintaining organization and an active inventory of these sample collections; and providing access to these collections for study and reuse. This collections inventory has been compiled, organized, and released as a searchable database to provide researchers and the general public with means to discover and request scientific sample material preserved and maintained by the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center Samples Repository. Updates are made to the inventory as the collections grow, and version history information is available online to document additions and changes to the database.
