This dataset includes 63 still images extracted from digital video imagery of sediment grab samples, along with laboratory grain size analysis of the sediment grab samples, taken from the mouth of the Columbia River, OR and WA, USA. Digital video was collected in September 2014 in the mouth of the Columbia River, USA, as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program contribution to the Office of Naval Research funded River and Inlets Dynamics experiment (RIVET II). Still images were extracted from the underwater video footage whenever the camera was resting on the sediment bed and individual sediment grains were visible and in focus. The images were used to calculate the calibration curve through auto-correlation regressed against the results of laboratory-determined median grain size (D50) of the grab samples (Barnard, 2007), provided in an accompanying .csv file.
