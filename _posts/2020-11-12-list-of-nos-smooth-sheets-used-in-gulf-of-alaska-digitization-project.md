This table lists the NOS smooth sheets included in the associated shapefile (GulfofAlaskaDigitizationProject_NOSSeafloorCharacter.zip; N = 329, plus insets), the number of samples for each smooth sheet, the year of collection (1892 to 2001), and the smooth sheet scale (from 1:2,000 to 1:600,000). Smooth sheets are available through the National Geophysics Data Centerâ€™s online data portal (NDGC, http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov).
