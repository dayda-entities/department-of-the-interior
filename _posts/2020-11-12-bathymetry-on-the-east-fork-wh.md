These data are bathymetry (river bottom elevation) in XYZ format, generated from the March 29-30, 2017 and April 13, 2017, bathymetric survey of the East Fork White River at Columbus, Indiana. The bathymetry was collected from approximately the confluence of Driftwood and Flatrock rivers, downstream to the confluence of Haw Creek. Hydrographic data were collected using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) with integrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). Data were collected as the surveying vessel traversed the river, approximately perpendicular to the velocity vectors at 55 cross sections which were spaced 200 feet apart along the river. Additional cross sections were collected upstream and downstream of the low-head dam in Columbus, Indiana, as well. Data collection software integrated and stored the depth and DGPS data from the ADCP. Real-time kinematic GPS was collected at each cross section recording the water-surface elevation. Data processing required computer software to extract bathymetry data from the raw data files and to compile the information. The final csv file contains columns of Longitude and Latitude in degrees WGS84, and Elevation in feet NAVD88.
