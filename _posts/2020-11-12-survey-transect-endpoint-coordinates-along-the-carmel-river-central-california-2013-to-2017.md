This dataset contains the easting, northing and elevation values of the river right and river left endpoints from four to six survey transects at each of 10 sites along the Carmel River, central California. Topographic surveys were completed during four summer surveys (in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017). See https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a2720a6e4b03852bafc8eaf for accompanying elevation measurements. All data were collected in NAD83 UTM10N horizontal coordinates and NAVD88 Geoid 12B vertical coordinates, in units of meters.
