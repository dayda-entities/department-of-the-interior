Topographic surveys were completed during four summer surveys (in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017) at 10 sites along the Carmel River, CA. Topographic measurements were made at multiple locations along four to six transects per site using a total station (at sites CR, RS, DM and SH) and with an auto level and survey rod (at sites DDU, DDL, BW, SR, SC and CRO). This dataset contains the cross-sectional elevation measurements for each transect and survey year. The elevation measurement locations along each transect were located by measuring distances between corresponding endpoint coordinates, starting from river left (see https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5a271f8ce4b03852bafc8eaa for transect endpoint locations). Transect coordinates were collected in NAD83 UTM10N horizontal coordinates and elevation data are in NAVD88 Geoid 12B vertical coordinates, in units of meters.
