Satellite-tracked, DGPS-equipped Lagrangian surface-current drifter deployments were conducted over 12 weeks between 14 April and 7 July 2015 at various locations within and offshore of the National Park of American Samoa study area to track surface currents. The drifters internally logged their location every 1 minute, and they transmitted their positions to satellites every 5 minutes. A drogue was attached to the drifters at 1 m below sea level in order to track the currents at that depth.
