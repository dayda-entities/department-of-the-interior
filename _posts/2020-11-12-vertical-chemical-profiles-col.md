Natural cave passages penetrating a coastal aquifer in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) were accessed to test the hypothesis that chemoclines associated with salinity gradients (haloclines) within the flooded cave networks of the karst subterranean estuary are sites of methane oxidation. Two field trips were carried out to the fully-submerged cave system located 6.6 km inland from the coastline in January 2015 and January 2016. Vertical chemical profiles across the water column haloclines were obtained using the OctoPiPi (OPP), a high-resolution water sampler built by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The sampling efforts resulted in cm-scale profiles of major ions (e.g., chloride and sulfate), as well as concentrations and stable carbon isotopic values of methane, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Field activities were carried out by the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program in conjunction with Texas A&M University at Galveston
