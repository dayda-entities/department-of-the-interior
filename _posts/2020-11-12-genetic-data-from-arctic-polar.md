Fragment data from 11 nuclear microsatellite loci and sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene were gathered from Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. Mitogenomic analyses of Arctic cod and three other co-distributed gadoids (Polar cod [Arctogadus glacialis], Saffron cod [Eleginus gracilis], Walleye Pollock [Gadus chalcogrammus]) were also completed. Transcriptomic analyses of Arctic cod were used to identify genes associated with environmental perturbations. Genome-wide scans using RAD-Seq of Arctic cod and the co-distributed Polar Cod were collected.
