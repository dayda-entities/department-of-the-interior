Glacier Bay, Alaska oceanographic observations in CSV format beginning 1993.  Includes salinity, temperature, sigma-t, PAR, turbidity, Chlorophyll-a proxy, and dissolved oxygen in vertical profile for 22 stations.

Data are sensor information obtained from oceanographic CTDs. These are created by taking raw CTD data and normalizing them against individual calibration parameters for each CTD sensor. Quality control measures include standardizing readings among multiple CTDs with different sensitivities. Data were collected beginning in 1993 under the auspices of USGS. These data were identified as an I&M network vital sign in 2008. Beginning in calendar year 2009, data responsibility was transferred to NPS SEAN. Spatial coverage includes the inside waters of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, as well as an adjoining area in Icy Strait, Alaska.

The file is cumulative from 1993. A revised file reflecting the latest content is typically generated annually.

This product is created from individual OC_C CNV File data to which OC_M Quality Assessment grades are applied.  Each record contains a field listing the protocol package ID which defines its content.  Since this deliverable contains cumulative data, more than one protocol package ID is typically referenced within the file.

All deliverables under this reference have passed quality control processing specified in the protocol active at the time of processing.  All deliverables have been "accepted" for dissemination by the principal investigator or a delegate.
