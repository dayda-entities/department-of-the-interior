Tabular data are sensor information obtained from oceanographic CTD instruments in the vicinity of Glacier Bay National Park beginning in 1993. These are created by taking raw CTD data and normalizing them against individual calibration parameters for each CTD sensor. Quality control measures include enforced compliance to mandatory validation criteria specified in protocol OC-2010.1 (Danielson et al. 2010) . Data were collected beginning in 1993 under the auspices of USGS. These data were identified as an I&M network vital sign in 2008. Beginning in calendar year 2009, monitoring responsibility was assumed by NPS SEAN. USGS data were recalculated from the original raw instrument "hex" data using the processes, form, and quality control specifications of the protocol. Spatial coverage includes the inside waters of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, as well as an adjoining area in Icy Strait, Alaska. Temporal coverage is July 1993 through the present.
