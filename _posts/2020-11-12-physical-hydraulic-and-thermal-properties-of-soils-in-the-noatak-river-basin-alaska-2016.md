This dataset includes physical, hydraulic, and thermal properties of soils collected in two sub-watersheds in the Noatak River Basin in northwestern Alaska. Physical properties include dry bulk density and porosity. Hydraulic properties include field- and lab-based hydraulic conductivity, soil-water retention data, and parameters used in a common soil-water retention model (van Genuchten model). Thermal properties include thermal conductivity, resistivity, diffusivity, and specific heat capacity.
