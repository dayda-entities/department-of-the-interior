This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, in September 2013 (USGS Field Activity W-07-13-PS). Surface sediment was collected from 62 locations using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler from the R/V Frontier on September 19, 2013 in depths between about 1 and 12 m around the delta. An additional 21 sediment samples were collected between September 16 and September 19, 2013 at low tide from intertidal locations on the delta. The locations of grab samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
