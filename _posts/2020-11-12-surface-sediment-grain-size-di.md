This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, in May 2014 (USGS Field Activity 2014-620-FA). Surface sediment was collected from 43 locations using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler from a small boat on May 12, 2014 in depths between about 1 and 12 m around the delta. The locations of grab samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. Grab samples that yielded less than 50 g of sediment were omitted from analysis and are classified as "no sample". The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
