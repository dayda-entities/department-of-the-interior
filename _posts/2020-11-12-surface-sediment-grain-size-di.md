This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, in March 2013 (USGS Field Activity W-01-13-PS). Surface sediment was sampled using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler on March 4, 2013 from the R/V Frontier at a total of 48 locations in water depths between about 1 and 12 m around the delta. An additional 7 sediment samples were collected between March 6 and March 7, 2013 at low tide from intertidal locations on the delta. The locations of grab samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. Grab samples that yielded less than 50 g of sediment were omitted from analysis and are classified as "no sample". The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
