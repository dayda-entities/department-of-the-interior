This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, between July and August 2015 (USGS Field Activities 2015-648-FA and 2015-652-FA). Surface sediment was collected from 70 locations using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler from the R/V Frontier on July 28, 2015. An additional 17 sediment samples were collected between July 22 and August 23, 2015 by scuba divers. Forty-eight sediment samples were collected at low tide using a push corer at intertidal locations on the delta. The locations of grab samples and intertidal samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Samples obtained by divers were collected adjacent to fixed monuments on the seabed with previously determined coordinates. The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
