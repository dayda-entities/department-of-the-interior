This data set includes dissolved oxygen (DO) and specific conductivity (SpC) data collected in both the surface water and shallow streambed at the Quashnet River, Mashpee, USA from 2014-16. This data was collected to better understand groundwater discharge to the river and associated brook trout habitat. DO was typically near saturation in surface water and some groundwater, but is reduced in streambed zones that may be influenced by buried peat lenses. SpC was used as an indicator of groundwater flowpath dynamics, and lower values were generally associated with higher DO.
