This data set contains U-Pb isotopic data and associated ages of titanite from one sample and detrital zircon grains from 33 sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks collected from the western Alaska Range in south-central Alaska. The samples were collected as part of geological mapping and research conducted between 2010 and 2014 and funded by the Mineral Resources Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. Titanite was separated by Apatite to Zircon, Inc. (A2Z) and analyzed by USGS research staff at the Stanford-US Geological Survey (USGS) Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe with Reverse-Geometry (SHRIMP-RG) at Stanford University. Detrital zircon grains from each of the 33 samples were separated and analyzed by Apatite to Zircon, Inc. (A2Z) and GeoSep Services (GSS) laboratories between 2011 and 2014, using laser-ablation-inductively-coupled-plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques described in the supplemental file. The data tables report the concentration of the radioactive elements uranium (U) and thorium (Th) measured in each grain, corrected ratios of two isotopes of lead (207Pb and 206Pb) to two isotopes of uranium (235U and 238U), and the geologic age of each grain calculated from the isotopic ratios. The titanite data table also reports concentrations of selected trace elements measured in each grain.
