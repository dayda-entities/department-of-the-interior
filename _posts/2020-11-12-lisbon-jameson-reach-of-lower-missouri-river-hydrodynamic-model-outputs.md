Data set contains depth and velocity grids centerpoints generated from hydrodynamic model (SRH-2D) simulations run for a range of discharges. Date range corresponds to month(s) that bathymetric survey was performed. Three study reaches were considered in this analysis: the Fairview reach of the Yellowstone River, MT, the Miami and Lisbon-Jameson reaches of the Lower Missouir River. Data and application are described in detail in accompanying journal article (Erwin et al., 2017).
