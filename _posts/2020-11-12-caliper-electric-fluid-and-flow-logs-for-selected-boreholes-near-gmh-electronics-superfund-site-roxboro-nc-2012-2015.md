The collection of borehole geophysical logs and images and continuous water-level data was conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey South Atlantic Water Science Center in the vicinity of the GMH Electronics Superfund site near Roxboro, North Carolina, during December 2012 through July 2015. The study purpose was part of a continued effort to assist the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the development of a conceptual groundwater model for the assessment of current contaminant distribution and future migration of contaminants. Previous work by the U.S. Geological Survey South Atlantic Water Science Center at the site involved similar data collection, in addition to surface geologic mapping and passive diffusion bag sampling within monitoring wells (Chapman and others, 2013). Geophysical logs, borehole imagery, pumping data, and heat-pulse flow measurements were collected and are presented within this data release. The data within this page contain .csv files with caliper, natural gamma, resistivity, fluid temperature, fluid specific conductance, and heat-pulse flow measurements (ambient and stressed conditions).
