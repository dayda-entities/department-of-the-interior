Field Methods:
I will sample salamanders at five locations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Collections will take place during June 2015. D. quadramaculatus and D. marmoratus will be located by visually searching streams, stream edges, and beneath rocks within streams. All efforts will be made to minimize impact on the habitat. Each salamander found will be hand-captured and placed in a new, clean plastic bag with a small amount of water to keep their skin moist. Salamanders will then be measured with calipers for snout-vent length, tail length, and cranial length and width. An approximately 5 mm piece of tissue will be removed from the tail tip for use in genetic analyses. To minimize handling stress, salamander measurements and tissue collection will take place in the field, adjacent to capture sites, and salamanders will be released at their point of capture immediately afterwards.
