This dataset consists of survey data from bank profiles surveyed June 12 and June 24-26, 2013 at the edge of the active braid plain of Exit Creek, a stream draining Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska. The survey was conducted using Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinetic (GPS-RTK) transceivers and tied to monuments previously established by the U.S. Forest Service. Short transects (profiles) at 24 locations on the left edge of the braid plain and 12 locations on the right edge of the braid plain were surveyed for the purpose of characterizing the magnitude of bank height and whether the bank sloped up or down from the active braid plain. The intent of the survey was to provide detailed ground conditions at braid plain margins to supplement remotely sensed elevation data.
