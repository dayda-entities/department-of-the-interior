This part of the data release presents topography data from northern Monterey Bay, California collected in September 2017. Topography data were collected on foot with survey-grade global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers mounted on backpacks and with an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) using a GNSS receiver mounted at a measured height above the ground.
