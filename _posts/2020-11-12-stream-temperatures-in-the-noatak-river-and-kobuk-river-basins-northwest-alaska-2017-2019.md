This data set includes 15-minute interval data on stream temperature from low-order streams and main-stem rivers in the Noatak and Kobuk River valleys in Northwestern Alaska, collected during the summer months. The water temperatures were determined using a HOBO Water Temp Pro v2 (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA)with ±0.2 °C accuracy. Sensors were place in several locations within each stream as well as in the main river below the tributary junction in order to assess stream thermal state.
