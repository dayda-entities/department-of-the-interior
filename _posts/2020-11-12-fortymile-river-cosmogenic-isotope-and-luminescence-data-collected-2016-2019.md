This dataset comprises four tables containing cosmogenic beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 concentrations and related data, as well as infrared stimulated luminescence data, from samples collected at 21 sites along the Fortymile River in eastern Alaska and Yukon, Canada between 2016 to 2018, and processed between 2016 and 2019. The file “geology_siteLocations_Fortymile_bender_2020.csv” contains site locations in the NAD83 reference frame, and depositional ages or erosion rates computed from raw data contained in the other files. All files are linked by the “site_id” field.
