In spring and summer 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Gas Hydrates Project conducted two cruises aboard the research vessel Hugh R. Sharp to explore the geology, chemistry, ecology, physics, and oceanography of sea-floor methane seeps and water column gas plumes on the northern U.S. Atlantic margin between the Baltimore and Keller Canyons. Split-beam and multibeam echo sounders and a chirp subbottom profiler were deployed during the cruises to map water column backscatter, sea-floor bathymetry and backscatter, and subsurface stratigraphy associated with known and undiscovered sea-floor methane seeps. The first cruise, known as the Interagency Mission for Methane Research on Seafloor Seeps and designated as field activity 2017-001-FA, was conducted from May 4 to May 11, 2017, and acquired geophysical data to support remotely operated vehicle exploration of seep sites using the Global Explorer, which is operated by Oceaneering International, Inc. Geophysical operations during cruise 2017-002-FA from August 25 to September 6, 2017, were also focused on mapping water column methane plumes, sea-floor seep sites, and subseafloor strata, but primarily supported conductivity, temperature, and depth instrument deployment, surface-water methane-concentration mapping, and water-sampling operations as part of a collaborative study with the University of Rochester of the effect of methane seepage on ocean water biogeochemistry. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research partially sponsored cruise 2017-001-FA, and the U.S. Department of Energy partially sponsored both cruises.
