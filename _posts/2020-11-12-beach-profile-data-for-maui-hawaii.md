Biannual beach profiles were collected at 42 Oahu and 36 Maui Locations between August 1994 and August 1999. Surveys were conducted at approximately summer-winter intervals and extend from landward of the active beach to about -4 meters water depth. Profile data on this CDROM are presented in both Microsoft EXCEL 97/98 & 5.0/95 Workbook (.xls) format and comma separated value (.csv) format. Graphical representation of the surveys (x vs. z and x vs. y) are presented in EXCEL format only. Site descriptions, including beach location, directions to site, GPS information, and a description of Reference Points used, are available in both EXCEL and ADOBE ACROBAT .pdf format.
