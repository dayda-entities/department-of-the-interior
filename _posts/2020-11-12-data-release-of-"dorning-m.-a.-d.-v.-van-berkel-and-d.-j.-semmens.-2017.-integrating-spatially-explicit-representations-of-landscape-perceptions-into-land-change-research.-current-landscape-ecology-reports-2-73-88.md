This data file contains a list of journal articles found in a recent search for research relevant to studying landscape perceptions. We collected all peer reviewed academic articles containing the keywords “landscape” and “perception” on the web of science resulting in 3497 records. To eliminate studies not directly addressing landscape perception we filtered out medical journal articles (n=1211). We also chose to limit our assessment to journals directly concerned with the landscape perception topic, omitting those with fewer than 5 articles pertaining to these keywords (n=1044). The abstract and title of the remaining articles (n=1242) were further scanned to discard irrelevant studies and evaluate specific methods and techniques employed resulting in a total of 584 articles. The list also includes some relevant information pertaining to the article, including the article abstract, methods used in the study, the location of the study, and whether or not the article considers change in perceptions over time.
