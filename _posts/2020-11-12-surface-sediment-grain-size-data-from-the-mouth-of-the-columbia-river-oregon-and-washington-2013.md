This portion of the USGS data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected from the mouth of the Columbia River, Oregon and Washington, in 2013. Surface sediment was sampled using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler on May 9, 2013 from the F/V Cape Windy at 3 locations. A handheld global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver was used to determine the locations of sediment samples. The grain size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
