An Innerspace 456 single-beam echosounder in conjunction with a Trimble® differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), HYPACK® navigation software, and Ashtech Z-Xtreme and Trimble® R8 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers was used to survey 7 chutes and 3 backwaters on the Missouri River yearly from 2011-13. These chutes and backwaters are located on the Missouri River between Newcastle, Nebraska and Rulo, Nebraska in the States of Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri. Surveys of chutes consisted of topographic and bathymetric data collected along transects spaced 30.48 m apart from high bank to high bank. Surveys of backwaters consisted of topographic and bathymetric data collected along a transect grid of 76.2 m spacing. The data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Omaha District as part of the Missouri River Habitat Assessment and Monitoring Program.
