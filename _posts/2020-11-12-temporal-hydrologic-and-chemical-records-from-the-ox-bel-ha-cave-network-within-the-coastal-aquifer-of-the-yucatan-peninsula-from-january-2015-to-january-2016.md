Natural cave passages penetrating a coastal aquifer in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) were accessed to investigate how regional meteorology and hydrology control methane dynamics in karst subterranean estuaries. Three field trips were carried out in January 2015, June 2015, and January 2016 to obtain year-long high-resolution temporal records of water chemistry and environmental parameters below and above the surface at a site (Cenote Bang) within the Ox Bel Ha cave network. These efforts resulted in chemical records of dissolved methane concentrations and its stable carbon isotopic content and major ion concentrations (i.e., chloride and sulfate) in approximately 2.5-day resolution from January 2015 to January 2016, sampled by OsmoSamplers. In addition, sensor-based measurements of environmental parameters include year-long precipitation, barometric pressure, water level, flow velocity, and water temperature records. Field activities were carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program in conjunction with Texas AM University at Galveston.
