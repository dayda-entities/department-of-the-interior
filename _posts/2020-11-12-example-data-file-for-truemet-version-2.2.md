This file is an example data set from the Central Valley of California from a drought study corresponding to “recent non-drought conditions” (Scenario 1 in Petrie et al., in review). In 2014, following an 8-year period with 7 below-normal to critically-dry water years, the bioenergetic model TRUEMET was used to assess the impacts of drought on wintering waterfowl habitat and bioenergetics in the Central Valley of California. The goal of the study was to assess whether available foraging habitats could provide enough food to support waterfowl populations (ducks and geese) under a variety of climate and population level scenarios. This information could then be used by managers to adapt their waterfowl habitat management plans to drought conditions. The study area spanned the Central Valley and included the Sacramento Valley in the north, the San Joaquin Valley in the south, and Suisun Marsh and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta) east of San Francisco Bay. The data set consists of two foraging guilds (ducks and geese/swans) and five forage types: harvested corn, rice (flooded), rice (unflooded), wetland invertebrates and wetland moist soil seeds. For more background on the data set, see Petrie et al. in review.
