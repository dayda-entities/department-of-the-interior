These data comprise of hydroacoustic backscatter data along transects in the North Pacific and Bering Sea conducted in August 2012 and 2014. We echointegrated hydroactoustic backscatter and used that as a proxy for forage fish biomass. The dataset consists of comma delimited files for 120Hz frequency. Each file contains analysis exports from EchoView Software Pty Ltd. ver. 5.4.
