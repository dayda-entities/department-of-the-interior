This dataset includes soil data collected from various landscapes adjacent to thaw ponds on the North Slope of Alaska between 2012 and 2018. The landscapes include ice-rich polygonal ground found on basin uplands, as well as bluffs and lake edges. At each site a visual description of soil type and texture was performed, and a permafrost probe was used to determine a 'depth to refusal'. Given that the soils are mostly fine-grained and there were no obvious rock strikes, we believe that 'depth to refusal' indicates the thaw depth. Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined in most locations using a Guelph Permeameter.
