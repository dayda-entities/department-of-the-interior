This dataset contains the locations of independent survey points acquired on the same day that images were obtained from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) flown in the Cape Cod National Seashore. The overall objective of the field work was to evaluate the quality and cost of mapping from UAS images. Low-altitude (approximately 120 meters above ground level) digital images were obtained from cameras in a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flown from the lawn adjacent to the Coast Guard Beach parking lot on 1 March, 2016. U.S. Geological Survey technicians deployed and mapped 28 targets that appear in some of the images for use as ground control points. All activities were conducted according to Federal Aviation Administration regulations and under a National Park Service Scientific Research and Collecting Permit, study number CACO-00285, permit number CACO-2016-SCI-003. This dataset contains locations of both in place and placed targets that may be used as ground control to constrain photogrammetric reconstructions. One hundred and forty-four (144) points were measured along several cross-shore transects on the beach. These points were measured with real-time differential global positioning system (GPS) and have horizontal and vertical uncertainties of approximately +/ 0.03 m. These points were not used in photogrammetric processing, so they can be used for independent evaluation of photogrammetric products. The independent survey points are listed in file CACO_transect_Points_20160301.csv.
