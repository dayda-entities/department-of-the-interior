The resource contains general environment data from the ABR, Inc. – Environmental Research and Services (ABR) 2019 ground surveys, and the 2013 Alaska Ecoscience Hula Hula & Dalton Hwy dataset. The ABR 2019 aerial survey data and 1987-1992 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plots from Jorgenson et al. (1994) are included here, but only have a land cover class assigned. This is because the Jorgenson et al. (1994) dataset did not include general environment data. See the deliverable file “abr_anwr_ns_lc_veg_aerial_deliverable.csv” for general environment data from the 2019 ABR aerial surveys.

The data in this resource relates to the other data deliverable resources through the project_id and plot_id fields.
