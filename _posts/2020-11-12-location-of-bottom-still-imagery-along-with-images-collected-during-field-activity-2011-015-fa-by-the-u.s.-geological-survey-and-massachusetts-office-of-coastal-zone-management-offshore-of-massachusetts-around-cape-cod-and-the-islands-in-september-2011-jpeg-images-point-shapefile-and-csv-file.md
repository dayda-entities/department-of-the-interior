Accurate data and maps of sea-floor geology are important first steps toward protecting habitat, delineating marine resources, and assessing environmental changes due to natural or human effects. Initiated in 2003, the primary objective of the Geologic Mapping of the Massachusetts Sea Floor program is to develop regional geologic framework information for the management of coastal and marine resources. The project is focused on the inshore waters (5–30 meters deep) of Massachusetts. This dataset is from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) sampling survey 2011-015-FA (September 9–16, 2011) by the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center and the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management with partners from the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aboard the ocean survey vessel Bold. During the survey, surficial sediment samples and bottom still and video imagery were collected in Cape Cod Bay, Buzzards Bay, and Vineyard Sound; south of Martha's Vineyard; and south and east of Nantucket, Massachusetts.
