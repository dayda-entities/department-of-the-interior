This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, in August 2012 (USGS Field Activity W-05-12-PS). Surface sediment was sampled using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler between August 28 and August 30, 2012 from the R/V Frontier at a total of 57 locations in water depths between about 1 and 9 m around the delta. The locations of grab samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. Grab samples that yielded less than 50 g of sediment were omitted from analysis and are classified as "no sample". The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
