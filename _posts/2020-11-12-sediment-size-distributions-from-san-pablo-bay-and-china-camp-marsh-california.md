As part of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport investigations in San Pablo Bay and China Camp Marsh, California, particle size distributions of bed sediments were measured at most instrumented stations and are presented in a comma-delimited values spreadsheet. This portion of the data release presents San Pablo Bay and China Camp Marsh sediment particle size distributions from samples collected during multiple instrument deployments. Users are advised to check the data carefully for sampling time, location, and reference information.
