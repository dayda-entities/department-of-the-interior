Deliverable KM_I is comprised of one CSV file per year. It contains the waypoint data recorded on external GPS devices in the course of murrelet surveys. They are intended to mark locations of exceptional events during the survey and serve as backup in case equipment failure forces the crew to record observations using the paper form process.

This data product has been compared against the formal quality criteria specified in the protocol package in effect at the time of data collection, found to be in complete compliance, and accepted by the program lead for public dissemination.

Deliverable KM_I is fully defined in the protocol document package available at NPS Data Store reference 2204691.
