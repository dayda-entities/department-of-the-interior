Low-altitude (80-100 meters above ground level) digital images of Town Neck Beach in Sandwich, Massachusetts were obtained from a camera mounted on a small unmanned aerial system (UAS; also known as a drone). Imagery was collected at close to low tide on seven days to observe changes in beach and dune morphology. The images were geolocated by using the single-frequency geographic positioning system aboard the UAS. Ground control points (GCPs) were established by using temporary targets on the ground, which were located by using a real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system (RTK-GNSS) base station and rovers. The GCPs can be used as constraints during photogrammetric processing. Transect points were collected by using the same RTK-GNSS system; these can be used to evaluate photogrammetric products. This data release includes georeferenced images, image-location files, GCPs, and transect points. Collection of these data was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal and Marine Geology Program and were conducted under USGS field activity numbers 2017-005-FA, 2017-008-FA, 2017-010-FA, 2017-014-FA, 2017-029-FA, and 2017-050-FA.
