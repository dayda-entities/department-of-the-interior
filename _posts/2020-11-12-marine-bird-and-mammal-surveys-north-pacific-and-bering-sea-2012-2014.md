This dataset describes marine bird and mammal surveys conducted in August 2012-2014 in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Data were collected to document the at-sea distribution and abundance of marine birds and mammals, and were conducted using standard strip width transect protocols (Gould and Forsell 1989). One observer and one recorder identified and counted birds on transect at all times. Surveys were recorded using a DLOG system and exported into a .csv file. This dataset contains survey data consisting of: date, time, latitude, longitude, record number, data type, species, count, behavior, distance, observers, observer conditions, trip ID, beaufort, transect type, transect width (m), and comments.
