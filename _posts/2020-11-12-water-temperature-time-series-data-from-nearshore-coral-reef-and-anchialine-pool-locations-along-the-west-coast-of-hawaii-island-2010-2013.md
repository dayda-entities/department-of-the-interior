Time-series data of water temperature were collected at 33 locations along the west coast of the Island of Hawaii, including within Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park (KAHO), and Puu o Honaunau National Historical Park (PUHO) between 2010 and 2013 in nearshore coral reef and anchialine pool settings. Temperature sensors were attached to fossil limestone, rock or dead coral within otherwise healthy coral reef settings spanning water depths of 0.1 to 8.84 m (0.3 to 29.0 ft). Continuous measurements were made every 10 or 20 minutes. Due to the large amount of data, the dataset has been split into three files. WaterTempTimeSeries_KAHO-KC.csv includes data from nearshore coral reef locations within Kaloko Bay, which lies within the KAHO boundaries; WaterTempTimeSeries_KAHO.csv includes data from nearshore reef locations and two anchialine pools within the remainder of KAHO; WaterTempTimeSeries_westHawaii.csv includes data from nearshore coral reef locations along west Hawaii coastline, outside of the KAHO boundaries.
