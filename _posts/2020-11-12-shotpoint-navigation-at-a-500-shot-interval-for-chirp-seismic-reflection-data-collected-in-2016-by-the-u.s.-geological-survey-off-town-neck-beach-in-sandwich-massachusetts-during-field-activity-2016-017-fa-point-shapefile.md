Geophysical and geological survey data were collected off Town Neck Beach in Sandwich, Massachusetts, in May and July 2016. Approximately 130 linear kilometers of subbottom (seismic-reflection) and 234-kilohertz interferometric sonar (bathymetric and backscatter) data were collected along with sediment samples, sea floor photographs, and (or) video at 26 sites within the geophysical survey area. Sediment grab samples were collected at 19 of the 26 sampling sites and video and (or) photographic imagery of the sea floor were taken at all 26 sites. These survey data are used to characterize the sea floor by identifying sediment-texture, seabed morphology, and underlying geologic structure and stratigraphy. Data collected during these 2016 surveys are included in this data release: https://doi.org/10.5066/P9HZHXXV.
