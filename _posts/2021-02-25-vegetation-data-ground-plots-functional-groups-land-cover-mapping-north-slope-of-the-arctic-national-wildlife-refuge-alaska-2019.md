The resource contains the vegetation structure data from the ABR, Inc. â€“ Environmental Research and Services (ABR) 2019 ground surveys plots and the 2013 Alaska Ecoscience Hula Hula & Dalton Hwy dataset. The 1987-1992 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plots from Jorgenson et al. (1994) have little to no data in this table. These plots are included here because this table relates to the veg_cover table on project_id and plot_id and therefore must be included to satisfy the database constraints.

The data in this resource relates to the other data deliverable resources through the project_id and plot_id fields.
