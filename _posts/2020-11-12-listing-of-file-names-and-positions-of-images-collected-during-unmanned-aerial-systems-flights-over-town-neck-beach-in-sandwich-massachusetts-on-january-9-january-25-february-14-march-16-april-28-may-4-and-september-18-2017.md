Low-altitude (80-100 meters above ground level) digital images of Town Neck Beach in Sandwich, Massachusetts were obtained with a camera mounted on a small unmanned aerial system (UAS; also known as a drone). Imagery was collected at close to low tide on seven days to observe changes in beach and dune morphology. The images were geolocated by using the single-frequency geographic positioning system aboard the UAS. Ground control points (GCPs) were established by using temporary targets on the ground, which were located by using a real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system (RTK-GNSS) base station and rovers. The GCPs can be used as constraints during photogrammetric processing. Transect points were collected by using the same RTK-GNSS system; these can used to evaluate photogrammetric products. This data release includes georeferenced images, image-location files, GCPs, and transect points. Collection of these data was supported by the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program and were conducted under USGS field activity numbers 2017-005-FA, 2017-008-FA, 2017-010-FA, 2017-014-FA, 2017-027-FA, 2017-029-FA, and 2017-050-FA.
