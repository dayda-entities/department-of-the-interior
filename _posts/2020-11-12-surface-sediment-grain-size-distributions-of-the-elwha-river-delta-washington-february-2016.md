This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, in February 2016. Surface sediment was collected from 83 locations using a small ponar, or 'grab' sampler from the R/V Frontier in water depths between 17 and 1 m around the delta. An additional 18 samples were collected by hand at low tide. A handheld global satellite navigation system (GNSS) receiver was used to determine the locations of sediment samples. The grain size distributions of suitable samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. Grab samples that yielded less than 50 g of sediment were omitted from analysis and are classified as "no sample". The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
