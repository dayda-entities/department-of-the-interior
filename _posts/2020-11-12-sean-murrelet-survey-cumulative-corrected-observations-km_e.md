During GLBA field surveys, murrelet group observation data are recorded.  The GPS location and covariates are captured at the rate of once every two seconds. If there is also a bird group cited, those details are written to the record as well. This single file covers all data points collected since 7/5/2011.

This data product has been compared against the formal quality criteria specified in protocol KM-2012.1, found to be in complete compliance, and accepted by the program lead for public dissemination on 9/15/2017.
