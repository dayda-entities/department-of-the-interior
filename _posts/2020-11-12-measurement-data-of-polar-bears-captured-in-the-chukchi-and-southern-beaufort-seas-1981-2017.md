This dataset includes measures collected on polar bears captured in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, 1981-2017 by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Data collected include body length, body mass, axillary girth, skull width and tail lengths. Bears were also aged as described in the methods. For some bears, an adipose tissue sample was collected and percent lipid content was measured, percent body fat was measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis, and/or recent feeding behavior was assessed via gut palpitation or blood urea and creatinine levels, all of which are further described in the methods.
