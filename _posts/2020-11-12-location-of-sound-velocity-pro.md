The Delmarva Peninsula is a 220-kilometer-long headland, spit, and barrier island complex that was significantly affected by Hurricane Sandy in the fall of 2012. The U.S. Geological Survey conducted cruises during the summers of 2014 and 2015 to map the inner continental shelf of the Delmarva Peninsula using geophysical and sampling techniques to define the geologic framework that governs coastal system evolution at storm-event and longer timescales. Geophysical data collected during the cruises include swath bathymetric, sidescan sonar, chirp and boomer seismic reflection profiles, grab sample and bottom photograph data. More information about the USGS survey conducted as part of the Hurricane Sandy Response-- Geologic Framework and Coastal Vulnerability Study can be found at the project website or on the WHCMSC Field Activity Web pages: https://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/delmarva/, https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=2014-002-FA and https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/fan_info.php?fan=2015-001-FA.
