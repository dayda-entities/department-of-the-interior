These data represent estimates of den entrance and exit dates for female polar bears in the southern Beaufort and Chukchi Seas based on temperature sensor data obtained from satellite collars. An algorithm described in Olson et al. (2016) was used to determine whether the female entered a den and further analyses using temperature data as described in Olson et al. (2017) were used to assess den entry and emergence dates. The algorithm used identified periods in which temperature remained consistently above a temperature threshold. As such, users of these data should be aware that bear behavior can affect den entrance and exit date. If a bear moves in and out of a den frequently, the algorithm identifies that bear as not denning. Den substrate was determined by examining satellite locations from collars during the identified denning period and classify dens as occurring on landfast ice, sea ice, or land. This data set also includes direct observations of females post-den emergence including whether or not she was accompanied by cubs as an indicator of reproductive success.
