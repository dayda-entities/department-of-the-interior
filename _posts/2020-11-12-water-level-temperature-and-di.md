This data set includes 15-minute interval data on stream temperature, stage, and discharge from low-order streams in the Yukon River Basin in interior Alaska, collected during the summer months. The depth of the water and temperature were determined using a combined pressure transducer and temperature sensor that was deployed through the summer months. Different sensors were used in each stream and year, so a file is included detailing the stage and temperature accuracy for each year and stream. Discharge was derived from the stage data by creating a rating curve relating stage to discharge measured during site visits.
