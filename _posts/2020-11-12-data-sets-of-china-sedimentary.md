These data sets include deposit description, location, and geochemistry of sedimentary rock-hosted (Carlin-type) Au deposits in P.R. China. Deposit data was compiled by U.S. Geological Survey and Tianjim Geological Academy into a series of tables (.xls and .csv) provided in Open-File Report 02-131, Appendix III and IV. Since the 1980s, Chinese geologists have devoted a large-scale exploration and research effort to the deposits. As a result, there are more than 20 million oz of proven Au reserves in sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in P.R. China. Additional estimated and inferred resources are present in over 160 deposits and occurrences, which are undergoing exploration. This makes China second to Nevada in contained ounces of Au in Carlin-type deposits. It is likely that many of the Carlin-type Au ore districts in China, when fully developed, could have resource potential comparable to the multi-1,000-tonne Au resource in northern Nevada.
