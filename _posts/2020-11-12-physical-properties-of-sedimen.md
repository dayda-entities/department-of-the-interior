During the spring and summer of 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey participated in Indiaâ€™s National Gas Hydrate Program NGHP-02 expedition in the Krishna-Godavari Basin offshore eastern India. The expedition included conventional and pressure coring of sediment, samples of which were transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey in Woods Hole, MA for post-cruise testing. This data release contains measurement results for physical properties measured on recovered core material, including measurements on gas-hydrate-bearing sediment preserved in pressure cores, and physical properties of gas hydrate-free sediment recovered from conventional cores. This work is part of an international NGHP-02 collaboration culminating in a comprehensive collection of publications in a special volume of the journal Marine and Petroleum Geology.
