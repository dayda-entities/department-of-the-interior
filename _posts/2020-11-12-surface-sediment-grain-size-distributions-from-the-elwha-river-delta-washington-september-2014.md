This portion of the data release presents sediment grain-size data from samples collected on the Elwha River delta, Washington, in September 2014 (USGS Field Activity 2014-649-FA). Surface sediment was collected from 63 locations using a small ponar, or 'grab', sampler from the R/V Frontier on September 5, 2014 in depths between about 1 and 17 m around the delta. The locations of grab samples were determined with a hand-held global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The grain-size distributions of samples were determined using standard techniques developed by the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center sediment lab. The grain-size data are provided in a comma-delimited spreadsheet (.csv).
