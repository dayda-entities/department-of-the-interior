This dataset contains data from the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis and deuterium injection as methods to estimate the body composition of female polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation. Data are provided on bioelectrical impedance resistance measures, the enrichment level of deuterium oxide that was injected and measured in blood samples, and morphological measures.
