Data were collected to index the body condition of Tufted Puffin chicks on colonies in the North Pacific and Bering Sea during August or 2012-2014. This dataset contains information on every chick measured. Data consists of: colony name, date, wing chord (mm), mass (g), culmen (mm), tarsus (mm), body condition (mass/wing), and burrow observations. Chick body condition was only used for analyses if there were measurements from 12 or more chicks at each colony.
