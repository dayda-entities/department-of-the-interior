The resource contains general plot data, including location data (lat/long) from the ABR, Inc. â€“ Environmental Research and Services (ABR) 2019 ground and aerial surveys, the 2013 Alaska Ecoscience Hula Hula & Dalton Hwy dataset, and the 1987-1992 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plots from Jorgenson et al. (1994). Location data are missing for some plots in the Jorgenson et al. (1994), and this is how we received the data.

The data in this resource relates to the other data deliverable resources through the project_id and plot_id fields.
