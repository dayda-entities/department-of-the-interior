Daily values of discharge and sediment loads were measured and estimated at U.S. Geological Survey gaging station 12046260, on the Elwha River at the diversion near Port Angeles, Washington. Daily data are reported from September 15, 2011 to September 30, 2016. Specific data include (1) date; (2) discharge; (3) suspended-sediment concentration and one standard-deviation bounds; (4) percentage of fine-grained particles (silts and clays) in suspension; (5) loads of total suspended-sediment, fine-grained particles in suspension, and sand in suspension; (6) gauged bedload for particles between 2-16 mm and greater than 16 mm; and (7) estimated bedload for particles smaller than 2 mm.
